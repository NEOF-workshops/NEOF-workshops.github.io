__Lterdatasampler__ is a R package containing various datasets.
These datasets were generated by the [Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network](https://lternet.edu/).
They were curated into a R package by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/) and [Julien Brun](https://brunj7.github.io/).

For full information please see the [lterdatasampler website](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/)

## Install and load

Installation and loading instruction below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lterdatasampler")
library("lterdatasampler")
```

## Accessing data

Once you have installed and loaded the package you can access one of the various datasets as a [__tibble__](/tibble/tibble.qmd) like below:

```{r}
tibble::as_tibble(lterdatasampler::and_vertebrates)
```

## Datasets

Below is the infomration on all the datasets within the package (as of 25th April 2025)
