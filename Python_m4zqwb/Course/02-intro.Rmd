This is a course to explore and learn the fundamentals of programming in the Python language with a specific focus on how this tool can be used in bioinformatics.

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a high level programming language enabling very rapid development of applications or scripts. It has a simple, easy-to-read syntax and is very accessible as a first or second programming language. Python has many pre-built modules and packages, allowing you to import lots of functionality, and avoid the need to "re-invent the wheel".

Python is favoured by many programmers for the flexibility it affords and the speed at which it can be written.

This course assumes absolutely no Python experience or prior programming experience in any other language.

Over the next two days you will:

-   **Learn** the fundamental components of a Python script
-   **Discover** how to write, edit and run a Python script
-   **Understand** and use variables
-   **Understand** and choose data structures
-   **Use** control structure (conditions and loops)
-   **Learn** string manipulation
-   **Read** and manipulate DNA sequence data
-   **Be able to** read input files and write output files
-   **Have a plan** on what to do next to further your knowledge.

We will cover the theory behind Python concepts and terminology. Python code is designed to be human-readable and understanding the underlying processes is important. There will be lots of opportunity to practice writing Python. Practice will involve typing and running Python code whilst working through the workshop materials. This will allow you to see the output of Python commands and help you to understand how Python works.

## Materials Covered in the Course

After learning some of the basics of Python we will import some DNA sequence data and perform some common types of analyses. The focus is on learning the theory and the ways in which Python can be used, rather than the specifics of the analysis. Hopefully you will take away new skills that can be applied to your own data.

In the supplementary material, we import and work with a different form of data often encountered by biologists; the comma delimited file.

## Inputting Commands

Commands are in the following font and colour and should be run in the VNC window following the link provided to you by the course coordinators. (Do not try to run the following, however.)

```{python, eval=FALSE}
    This is an example of a command.
```

## Pseudocode
<center>![](figures/noun-cherry-cake-5973.png){width=15%}</center>

Sometimes to illustrate how a concept works, we will illustrate it with some <b>pseudocode</b>. This is a way of representing a concept in simple terms that can be understood without knowing the correct programming terminology or syntax.

Do not try to run the pseudocode as Python will not understand it.
