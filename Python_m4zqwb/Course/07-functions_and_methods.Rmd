__Functions__ and __methods__ are groups of instructions that together perform a specific task. 
This may be a task that you need to run repeatedly on your data.
By storing these instructions in a single __function/method__, you only need to enter the code once and simply re-use it each time. 
A __function/method__ returns a value after it has performed the specific task.

Use the same notebook (__"01-Fundamentals"__) and add the following __markdown cell__:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
## Functions & methods
### Functions
```

## Functions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/dna.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

A __function__ is a distinct piece of code which requires data for it to run.
To run a __function__ you need the name of the __function__ followed by a pair of braces (`()`) with the desired input within the braces. 

We have already used some __functions__: 
 
 - __`int()`__
 - __`str()`__
 - __`float()`__
 - __`type()`__
 
Imagine that we need to find the length of a __string__ of nucleotides (i.e. how many bases are in a piece of DNA).
In this instance, we can use the built-in `len()` __function__ on the __string__:

__Note__: Use any __string__ of 'ACGT' you like, no need to copy this one exactly.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Random DNA sequence
DNA1 = "ACGTGTTATATGCGCGTTAGTGTAGTCGATC"
#print the length of the DNA
len(DNA1)
```

Make another random length of DNA and check its length:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Random DNA sequence
DNA2 = "AGCTGACTGCATGATTGCTGATCAACAGT"
#print the length of the DNA
len(DNA2)
```

You can use the `+` __operator__ to paste 2 or more __strings__ together which is useful.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA3 = DNA1 + DNA2
DNA3
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
len(DNA3)
```

The below code incorporates previously made __variables__ and used __functions__.
Make a good attempt to understand it.
You can try running smaller parts of the code to more easily see what each part is doing (e.g. only run `str(X)`).
If you are unsure please ask a demonstrator, they are more than happy to help.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
maths_sentence = str(X) + " + " + str(V) + " = " + str(X + V)
maths_sentence
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
len(maths_sentence)
```

You'll notice that each character (including spaces ` `) adds to the length.

## Methods
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/percent.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

__Methods__ are very similar to __functions__ in that they process an input in some manner.
They differ in that __methods__ are associated with a particular data __class__ (__string__, for example) and are called via the data itself. 

__Methods__ are called using a different syntax; the __variable__ is followed by __`.`__ and the name of the __method__ with a pair of braces.

Create a new __markdown cell__ with the following:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
### Methods
```

Let's try a couple of __methods__ associated with manipulation of __string__ data:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Define a string called sequencers
sequencers = "illumina,oxford_nanopore,pac-bio"
```

The `upper()` __method__ converts string variables to upper-case.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
sequencers.upper()
```

The `split()` __method__ chops a string up wherever the specified sub-string occurs (comma in this case).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
sequencers.split(",")
```

Multiple __methods__ can be used in one line. 
This is the main advantage of the __method__ syntax.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
sequencers.upper().split(",")
```

We can also use built-in __methods__ for some simple analysis using the "DNA1" __string__ generated earlier.
Use the `count()` __method__ to count the number of each nucleotide in the string.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA1.count("A")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA1.count("C")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA1.count("G")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA1.count("T")
```

By using the `len()` __function__ and the `count()` __method__, we can calculate the GC content of the DNA1 sequence:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Count the number of Gs and Cs in the sequence
G_total = DNA1.count("G")
C_total = DNA1.count("C")
#Calculate the GC%
((G_total + C_total) / len(DNA1)) * 100
```

## Functions and methods MCQ recap

```

We have explored __functions__ (`function_name(variable)`) and __methods__ (`variable_name.method_name()`), and can now apply them to __variables__.
You'll learn more __functions__ and __methods__ throughout this course.

It is nigh impossible to learn all the __function__ and __methods__.
During this course and afterwards you can refer to the [cheatsheet in the appendix](#cheatsheet) to get a quick summary of all the __functions__ and __methods__ used in this book.
