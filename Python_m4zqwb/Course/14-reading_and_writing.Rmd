# Reading and writing files {#reading_writing}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/contract.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Often we want to __read__ from a data file, perform some task with the data, and __write__ out
another file.

To __read/write__ a file in Python we __open__ a data stream using a statement such as:

(don't add this line to the notebook)
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(path_to_file, 'open_mode') as input_file:
```

There are two parts to consider:

  - open(path_to_file, mode)
  
  - with(...`<input-file>`...) as input_file:
  
Create a new notebook with the name  __"05-Reading_and_writing"__ we'll learn to __open__, __read__, and __write__ files with it.
  
## 'open'
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/open_file.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

The `open` __function__ asks the Python interpreter to make a link to the specified file and __open__ a data stream.
We need to specify the __mode__ by which the file is __opened__.
The most common __modes__ are:
 
 - __'w'   - WRITE__: __Open__ for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be replaced by a new, empty file.
 - __'r'   - READ__: __Open__ an existing file for reading.
 - __'a'   - APPEND__: __Open__ for reading and writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, new data will be added to the end of the existing file.
 
There are other modes but these three cover the majority of file tasks.

## Read a data file
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/reading_glasses.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Create your first coding __cell__ in your __"05-Reading_and_writing"__ notebook. Add the location of your working directory and load the __SeqIO library__.

__Note__: Ensure `wd =` is set to __your__ working directory (not `nsc201`).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
wd = "/pub14/tea/nsc201/Python_course_data"
from Bio import SeqIO
```

Add the below code to __read__ the provided file __"patients_data.csv"__.
We have 2 new python words in the code:

- __`with`__: This python __statement__ allows us to carry out further tasks __with__ some data.
  - In this case we are using data __read__ from the file __"patients_gut_data.csv"__.
  - This is then passed to a __for loop statement__ to print each line of the file.
  - This is known as a __data stream__.
- __`as`__: This python __keyword__ creates an alias for our `with` __statement__.
  - In the below code we __open__ a file and store the read information as a __variable__ called `input_file`.
  - The variable name is arbitrary and chosen by the user.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Open input file for reading and add to a data stream
with open(wd + "/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through lines/rows of input_file
  for row in input_file:
    print(row)
```

When you run the code the file contents will be printed. We will learn to organise this output in a more usable way in the supplementary material).

## Write data to a file
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/write_feather.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Copy, paste, and edit your code to add a second __data stream__.
This is done by first opening a new file for __write__ access.

Looping through the `input_file`, for each row/line, we'll add the string "Study_2022," to the start.
This modified line/row will be __written__ to the output file using the `.write()` __method__.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Create output file for writing and add to a data stream
with open(wd + "/patients_modified.csv", 'w') as output_file:
  #Open input file for reading and add to a data stream
  with open(wd + "/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
    #Loop through lines/rows of input_file
    for row in input_file:
      #Write row/line to output_file
      output_file.write("Study_2022," + row)
```

Open your new file (__"patients_modified.csv"__) in the `jupyter-notebook` file navigator by clicking on it.
You will see that each row in the data now starts with the "Study_2022" __string__.

## Write out the filtered Undulate ray sequence data
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Leucoraja erinacea.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Returning to our example data relating to the undulate ray, we have a list of sequence records (trimmed_sequences).
These have passed our filters and we now want to write out the FASTQ file so that it might be further analysed using another piece of software.

<b>Return to your "04-Practical_python" notebook.</b>

At the bottom of the notebook, we'll __write__ the trimmed data to a new fastq file.
We can carry this out with `SeqIO's` built in `write()` __method__, specifying we want a FASTQ format file.

__Note:__ Ensure the __cells__ above your new __cell__ have been run.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Open a new file for writing and add it to a data stream
with open(wd + "/R_undulata_filtered_seqs.fastq", 'w') as output_file:
  #Write the previously created trimmed_sequence data to the output file as a fastq file
  SeqIO.write(trimmed_sequences, output_file, "fastq")
```  

This trimmed, filtered file would now be ready to go into whichever subsequent analysis was desired.

Use your `jupyter-notebook` file navigator to check that the file exists and that it is approximately 3MBs in size.

## Reading and writing MCQ recap

```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/question_bubble_red.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Grand! You've successfully finished this chapter.

For a quick recap, choose the correct option to complete the below sentences:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__`open()`__", "__`SeqIO.write()`__", "__`.write()`__")
```
1. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ __function__ is used to __read__, __write__, or __append__ data from/to files. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`open()`__", "__`SeqIO.write()`__", answer="__`.write()`__")
```
2. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ __method__ is used to __write__ data to a file. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`open()`__", answer="__`SeqIO.write()`__", "__`.write()`__")
```
3. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ __function__ is used to write biological data (such as fastq) to files. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`>=`__", "__`.startswith()`__", answer="__`with`__")
```
4. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ __statement__ opens a data stream allowing you to carry out more tasks with opened data. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__`>=`__", "__`.startswith()`__", "__`with`__")
```
5. In chapter 13 we checked the lengths of reads with the logical comparison \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`>=`__", answer="__`.startswith()`__", "__`with`__")
```
6. In chapter 13 we checked for the presence of a PCR sequence at the start of each sequence with the __method__ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. `r longmcq(opts_p)`
