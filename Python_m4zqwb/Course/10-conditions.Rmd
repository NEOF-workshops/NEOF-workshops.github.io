```

In this section we are going to learn some programmatic __Python__ coding including __conditions__ and __loops__.

Create a new notebook called __"03-Programmatic_coding"__. Use this notebook in this chapter.

## Logical conditions
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/logical.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

A powerful feature of most programming languages is the ability to compare values/**variables** and to make decisions based upon the outcome.
This type of behaviour is achieved using __logical conditions__.

The __conditions__ allowed depends on the type of data you are comparing.
You cannot use greater than (`>`) or less than (`<`) on **string variables** directly (although you could compare their lengths).

**Python supports the following logical conditions:**

- Equals: `a == b`
- Does not equal: `a != b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

Try the following:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
a = "ATTGCG"
b = "AGCGAT"
a==b
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
len(a) == len(b)
```

These logical conditions are most typically used in **if** statements.

## If statements
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/switch.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

By testing whether certain comparisons evaluate as either **True** or **False**, we can change the flow of our programs.

An **if statement** is a programming statement which acts like a switch.
If the statement is **True**, the switch is activated.
If the statement is **False**, the switch remains inactivated.

A generic **if statement** using pseudocode would have the following structure: <br>

1.  If a condition is met:

    2.  Perform a task
    
Try out the examples below. 
You will notice no results will appear when the conditions are `False`.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
if 1 == 1:
  print("1 is 1")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
if "team" != "teaim":
  print("There is no I in team")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
if (2+2) == 5:
  print("4 is equal to 5")
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
x = 8 * 8
y = 4 ** 3
if x < y:
  print(str(8*8) + " is less than " + str(4**3))
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
if x >= y:
  print(str(8*8) + " is greater or equal to  " + str(4**3))
```

## If else statements
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/wrong.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

We can also include an action for when the condition has not been met using **else**.
The **else statement** works in conjunction with the **if** and offers a different action if the condition evaluated to **False**.

1.  If a condition is met:
    -   Perform a task
2.  Else:
    -   Do something else

For example, we might have a string of nucleotide data which we want to move through, translating any thymine (T) bases into uracil (U).
The other three bases (A, C, and G) do not require any processing.

The **if** and **else statements** to do this would look something like (again, using pseudocode):

1.  If the current nucleotide is "T":
    -   Print "U"
2.  Else:
    -   Print the current nucleotide

We will explore using __loops__ to move through data more in the next chapter. For now, create the below __variables__ which we will use for some `if else statements`.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Create some DNA variables
a = "ATTGCG"
b = "AGCGAT"
c = "GGTCATtat"
```

### DNA length comparison
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/measuring_tape.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In the below code we create new variables for the __statement__.
This is so we only have to change the one set of __variables__ if we change the input data.
This is a common technique with __conditions__ and __loops__.
It is cumbersome and error prone to change all the __variables__ within the __statement__.

__Tip__: It is always useful to copy and paste code.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare lengths of a and b
dna1 = a
dna2 = b
if len(dna1) == len(dna2):
  print("DNA sequences are the same length")
else:
  print("Length difference is " + str(len(dna1) - len(dna2)))
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare lengths of a and c
dna1 = a
dna2 = c
if len(dna1) == len(dna2):
  print("DNA sequences are the same length")
else:
  print("Length difference is " + str(len(dna1) - len(dna2)))
```

### Nucleotide count comparison
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/abacus.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In the below examples we'll compare the number of specific nucleotides.
We'll use the __method__ `.count()`.
In this case we'll calculate the nucleotide content outside of the __condition__.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare A content of a and b
nt = "A"
nt_count_1 = a.count(nt)
nt_count_2 = b.count(nt)
if nt_count_1 == nt_count_2:
  print("DNA sequences have the same count of " + nt)
else:
  print("DNA sequences do not have the same count of " + nt)
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare A content of c and b
nt = "A"
nt_count_1 = c.count(nt)
nt_count_2 = b.count(nt)
if nt_count_1 == nt_count_2:
  print("DNA sequences have the same count of " + nt)
else:
  print("DNA sequences do not have the same count of " + nt)
```

You will notice both pieces of code say the compared sequences don't have the same amounts of As.
However `b` & `c` both have 2 As.
This result occurs as the __method__ `.count()` is case sensitive.
Therefore, it's counting 2 As for `b` and only 1 for `c`.

To fix this we'll also use the __method__ `.upper()`.
This is good practice with DNA sequences.

Edit your previous __code cells__ to:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare A content of a and b
nt = "A"
nt_count_1 = a.upper().count(nt)
nt_count_2 = b.upper().count(nt)
if nt_count_1 == nt_count_2:
  print("DNA sequences have the same count of " + nt)
else:
  print("DNA sequences do not have the same count of " + nt)
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Compare A content of c and b
nt = "A"
nt_count_1 = c.upper().count(nt)
nt_count_2 = b.upper().count(nt)
if nt_count_1 == nt_count_2:
  print("DNA sequences have the same count of " + nt)
else:
  print("DNA sequences do not have the same count of " + nt)
```

When you run the above code, they will now be correct for our purposes.

## Conditions reflection
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/reflection.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

**If** and **else statements** can be used to make decisions in our programs by comparing values.
This might be to check if two __strings__ are the same, two __lists__ contain the same number of items, or a __string__ of nucleotide data has 100 or more bases.
We can think of them as switches.

Often we need to make these **if**/**else** comparisons for every item in a data structure and to do this we can use loops.
