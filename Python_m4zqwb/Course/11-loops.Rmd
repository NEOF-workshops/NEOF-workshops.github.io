# Loops {#loops}
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }

```

We now have some knowledge of Python data structures (**lists**, **sets**, and **dictionaries**), what type of data they hold, and how we can access the elements within them.

How might we apply something to each element of a **list**? Perhaps we need to count the number of characters in each entry in the **list**?

Where we need to apply the same commands to every item in a data structure, we can use a **loop**. This means that we do not need to manually apply the commands to every item in the **list**, one at a time.

There are several types of **loop**; we will cover some of the most important in this section.

__Note__: Continue using the notebook __"03-Programmatic_coding"__ for this chapter.

## For Loops
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/assembly_line_robot.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

One of the most important and most common type of **loops** is the **for** **loop**.

The **for** **loop** runs through a set of **variables** (such as those in our list) and applies a **command** (or series of commands) to each element once. This is the **loop** that you will most often encounter.

Imagine you have a bag of 10 potatoes that you need to peel and put into a pot.

<center>![](./figures/potatoes.jpg){width="20%"}![](./figures/boiling_pot.webp){width="20%"}</center>

Using some pseudocode we can imagine how this script might look:

1)  from bag_of_potatoes pick up potato_01
2)  peel potato_01
3)  put potato_01 into pot
4)  from bag_of_potatoes pick up potato_02
5)  peel potato_02
6)  put potato_02 into pot ....(and so on)

You can see how inefficient this code is, especially if it was a particularly large bag of potatoes!

Instead, we can use a **for** **loop** to recycle the code.

1)  **for** each potato in bag_of_potatoes:
    2)  peel potato
    3)  put potato into pot

This **loop** would run until the bag of potatoes is empty, achieving the job in just three lines of code.

This pseudocode is actually very similar to the required Python syntax. The generic format of a **for** **loop** is:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
for <value> in <data_structure>:
  do something
```

Note the colon (`:`) starting the loop and the tab indent of any commands inside the loop.

### Loop through DNA nucleotides
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/loop_thru_dna.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

**For loops** are extremely useful when we have a lot of values (for example, in a **list**) and we need to apply some commands to all of them.

As an example, we will take a __string__ of DNA nucleotides and use a couple **loops** to generate the complement and reverse complement sequences.

Run the below code. 
The __for loop__ will move through the DNA string, printing each base to the screen.

__Note__: Ensure lines inside a __for loop__ are indented. 
Thankfully `jupyter-notebook` will automate a lot of this for you.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#DNA string variable, yours does not need to be exactly the same
DNA_string = "ATTCGAAGTCGTGTAGTACCGCGTATA"

#Loop through each base in the string
for base in DNA_string:
  #Print the current base
  print(base)
```

We can see from the output that the **loop** allows us to process each base in the string separately; in this case by printing them individually.

__Note__: The __loop variable name__ `base` is arbitrary and chosen by us.

### Complement a DNA sequence
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/complement.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Next, let's use this **loop** functionality to do something useful to each base such as converting each nucleotide to the appropriate complement base.

For this, we will use a **dictionary** to swap each base for the complement. Recall that a **dictionary** has a **key** and **value** for each entry. We can define the 'standard' base as the **key**, and the 'complement' as the **value**.

Create and run the below code in a new __code cell__.
With the code we first create the **dictionary** holding the complementary pairs of bases. 
This needs to come before the __for loop__. 

__Note__: Each of the four lines of the **dictionary** need to have a leading TAB character.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Complement
#DNA string variable, yours does not need to be exactly the same
DNA_string = "ATTCGAAGTCGTGTAGTACCGCGTATA"

#Define our dictionary of complements
complements = {
  "A" : "T",
  "T" : "A",
  "G" : "C",
  "C" : "G"
}

#Loop through each base in the string
for base in DNA_string:
  #Print the complemented base
  print(complements[base])
```

The code will print out the complementary base for each iteration of the loop.

Most likely we won't want our output to consist of separate bases on their own lines.
We can therefore build up an 'output __string__' to format the complemented sequence. 
The complemented base is added to the **variable** `complement_DNA` each time and the whole **string** is printed at the end.

Edit, your previous code to the following:

__Note:__ The **variable** `complement_DNA` needs to be created before the __for loop__ is run.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Complement
#DNA string variable, yours does not need to be exactly the same
DNA_string = "ATTCGAAGTCGTGTAGTACCGCGTATA"

#Define our dictionary of complements
complements = {
  "A" : "T",
  "T" : "A",
  "G" : "C",
  "C" : "G"
}

#Create an empty string to add the complemented bases to
complement_DNA = ""

#Loop through each base in the string
for base in DNA_string:
  #Print the complemented base
  #print(complements[base])
  #Add the complemented base to the output string
  complement_DNA = complement_DNA + complements[base]

#Print the output string
print(complement_DNA)
```

Now you have a __variable__ containing the complemented sequences.

### Reverse-complement a DNA sequence
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/reverse_complement.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

To generate the reverse complement we can use Python's built in `reversed()` **function** to reverse the __string__.
This reversed __string__ can then be used in the complementation. 
Copy your previous complementation code into a new __code cell__.
Edit it to the below and run it.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Reverse complement
#DNA string variable, yours does not need to be exactly the same
DNA_string = "ATTCGAAGTCGTGTAGTACCGCGTATA"

#Define our dictionary of complements
complements = {
  "A" : "T",
  "T" : "A",
  "G" : "C",
  "C" : "G"
}

#Create an empty string to add the complemented bases to
rc_DNA = ""

#Loop through each base in the reversed string
for base in reversed(DNA_string):
  #Add the complemented base to the output string
  rc_DNA = rc_DNA + complements[base]

#Print the output string
print(rc_DNA)
```

Running this new code will produce the reverse complement of our original DNA sequence.

### Transcription challenge
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '25%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/transcription.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In a new __code cell__ create and run code to transcribe the DNA (__"DNA_string"__) to a RNA sequence.
When a single strand of DNA is transcribed the resulting RNA strand is complemented with the relevant RNA bases.
For example, the DNA sequence __"ACGT"__ will become the RNA sequence __"UGCA"__.

Give this a good attempt, ensuring you copy and paste old code.

The solution is in the below expandable box if you want to check your code or you need a quick hint.

`r hide("Transcribe loop")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Transcribe
#DNA string variable, yours does not need to be exactly the same
DNA_string = "ATTCGAAGTCGTGTAGTACCGCGTATA"

#Define our dictionary of transcripts
transcripts = {
  "A" : "U",
  "T" : "A",
  "G" : "C",
  "C" : "G"
}

#Create an empty string to add the RNA bases to
RNA = ""

#Loop through each base in the string
for base in DNA_string:
  #Add the RNA base to the output string
  RNA = RNA + transcripts[base]

#Print the output string
print(RNA)
```
`r unhide()`

## While loops
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/while_loop.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

The other type of **loop** you might encounter is the **while** **loop**. A **while** **loop** continues to run **while** a statement remains **True**. For example, returning to our bag of potatoes, a **while** **loop** for the same job might look like this:

1)  while bag_of_potatoes is not empty :
    2)  peel potato
    3)  put potato into pot

This **loop** would run until the last potato has been prepared, at which point the __while statement__ would return **False** and the __loop__ would be stopped.

The generic format of a **while** **loop** is as follows:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
while <condition> :
  do something
```

Below are a few examples of __while loops__ you can create and run.
Ensure you understand why the code is giving you the output.
If you are not sure please ask a demonstrator.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
x = 1
#While loop
while x < 10:
  x = x + 1
x
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
x = 1
#Create new list containing 1 to add loop data to
num_list = [x]
#While loop
while x >= -9:
  x = x - 2
  num_list.append(x)
num_list
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Find first number after 101 that is divisible by 37
x  = 101
#Use modulus operator to end loop when the remainder from division is 0
while (x % 37) != 0:
  x = x + 1
x
```

**While** **loops** are much less commonly used and we will not spend any more time on them in this book. Hopefully you can see the difference between a **for** **loop** and a **while** **loop** and have an idea of how they run.

## Further control statements
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/controller.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

You can control **loops** further using __break__, __continue__ and __pass__ __statements__.
We won't cover these in this tutorial as they are much less common. 
You can find good resources covering __Python control statements__ [online](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loop_control.htm).

## Loop reflection
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/reflection.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

**Loops** are really useful when we need to perform the same task, or commands, over-and-over again. 
Where we have data stored in a data structure such as a **list**, we can apply something to everything in the **list** using a **for** **loop**. 
This is an efficient way to code as it means we do not need to duplicate the instructions.
