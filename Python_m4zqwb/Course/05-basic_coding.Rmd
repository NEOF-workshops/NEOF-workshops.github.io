## Introduction to commands and scripts
There are two important components to programming in __Python__; the commands that are committed by the user, and the interpreter which receives and implements the commands.

Each command can be thought of as a single instruction and these can be added together into a series of steps, called a script. 
Think about how a cooking recipe is often presented:

1) Break a few eggs
2) Make an omelette

These are two distinct *commands*, but together they form a *script* for how to transform raw eggs into an omelette.

## Issuing commands

In this section we will learn and use some __Python__ commands.

Create a new __notebook__ in your __"Python_course_data"__ directory. Rename it to __"01-Fundamentals"__ and save it.

Convert the first __cell__ to a __Markdown cell__. Add the following to the cell to create a 1st and 2nd level header.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# 1-Fundamentals
## Scripting
```

### Print
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/printer.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

The first command we will use is `print()`. This will print the desired text. Type and run the below commands in 2 new __Code cells__.

__Note__: Python is very particular about braces/brackets and quote marks.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("Hello, world!")
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("I'm excited to be learning some Python!")
```

Below each cell you will see the specified text.

### Working directory
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/directory.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

The command `getcwd()` stands for "get the *current working directory*". This command comes from the __Python module__ `os`. We therefore need to `import` the module and specify it when running the command (`os.getcwd()`). 

Run the below in a new cell.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import os
os.getcwd()
```

This will return something like: '/pub39/tea/nsc206/Python_course_data' (your nsc number will be different though).

`print()` and `os.getcwd()` are nice commands to start with but don't appear very useful, yet. We will see later how they can be used effectively.

## A note on indentation
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '10%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/tab.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

__Indentation__ refers to any __spaces__ or __tab__ characters at the beginning of a line of code. 
__Indentation__ helps readability of code.
It defines code blocks dedicated to a single purpose. 
However, __indentation__ in __Python__ is __mandatory__ and the interpreter will give an error if the __indentation__ is wrong.
  
`Jupyter-notebook` attempts to *auto* indent code.
However, you still need to take care that the level of indentation in the script matches that in the workbook __exactly__.
  
### Tabs vs spaces
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/indent_python_debate.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

There is an active debate about whether tabs or spaces are more appropriate for __indentation__. 

For reference, one tab = 4 spaces.
  
You can use either tabs or spaces, but you cannot use them interchangeably! Use one and keep consistent with your use.

Do not enter the below, this is just an illustration of how three levels of tab __indentation__ looks in a script.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Zero level of indentation
  # One level of indentation
    # Two levels of identation
# Zero level of indentation
```

## Scripting recap MCQs
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/question_bubble_black.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

Choose the correct option to complete the below sentences:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c(answer="__`getcwd()`__", "__`os`__", "__`print()`__")
```
1. The command ________ gets your current working directory. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`getcwd()`__", "__`os`__", answer="__`print()`__")
```
2. The command ________ prints text. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__`getcwd()`__", answer="__`os`__", "__`print()`__")
```
3. The module ________ is needed for the `getcwd()` command. `r longmcq(opts_p)`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("__Tabs__", "__Spaces__", answer="__Tabs or Spaces__")
```
4. ________ can be used for __indentation__ in __Python__. `r longmcq(opts_p)`
