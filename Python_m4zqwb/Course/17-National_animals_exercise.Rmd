# National animals exercise
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '25%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/tiger.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In this chapter you'll be going through a set of challenges which will involves a file containing information on the national animals of different countries. It contains two columns; __Country__ and __National Animal__. This dataset was found in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rambomind/countries-and-their-national-animals).

Along with using the skills and knowledge you have gained you will also learn a few new things.

Some of the challenges have hidden __tips__ (expandable boxes). For these exercises use the tip first before looking at the solution if you are having difficulty.

Please check the solution in the box even if your solution works. There are many ways to do the same thing in python and its good to see many different methods.

Create a new `jupyter-notebook` called __"08-National_animals_challenges"__ to attempt the challenges.

## NA challenge 1
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Momotus_aequatorialis.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Read in the file __"national-animals.csv"__ in your __"Python_course_data"__ directory. Then __print__ the line "The national animal of \<country\> is the \<animal\>" for each line in the file.

`r hide("National animals 1 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC1
#Read in the file using with statement
#If your jupyter notebook is in the same directory as the file you only need to provide the file name
with open("national-animals.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through the lines of input_file
  for row in input_file:
    #Set country and animal to variables using .split() method
    country = row.split(",")[0]
    animal = row.split(",")[1]
    #Print function
    print("The national animal of " + country + " is the " + animal)
```
`r unhide()`

You will notice that there are spaces between the lines. This is because there is a newline character (`\n`) at the end of each line in the file. You can remove these with the __method__ `.strip()`. It removes any leading (start of sentence) and trailing (end of sentence) white spaces (including `\n`). It's very useful to quickly clean the input from files.

__Note:__ The `.strip()`__method__ works on __strings__, not data from files. See the below solution for an example on how to use it.

`r hide("National animals 1 solution with .strip()")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC1
#Read in the file using with statement
#If your jupyter notebook is in the same directory as the file you only need to provide the file name
with open("national-animals.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through the lines of input_file
  #Can't strip input_file as it's aa file object
  for row in input_file:
    #Set country and animal to variables using .split() method
    country = row.split(",")[0]
    #Can strip the row variable as it is a string variable extracted from the file object
    animal = row.strip().split(",")[1]
    #Print function
    print("The national animal of " + country + " is the " + animal)
```
`r unhide()`

__Ensure__ you use `.strip()` in this challenge and the next to remove the `\n` characters.

## NA challenge 2
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '25%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Rhizoprionodon_terraenovae.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Read in the file __"national-animals.csv"__. Then convert the data into a dictionary called __"national_animals"__. Ensure the __key__ is the __country__ and the __value__ is the __animal__.

Once created __print__ the __dictionary's__ contents.

__Tip__: You may be able to copy and edit the __loop__ you made in the first challenge.

`r hide("National animals 2 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC2
#Create empty dictionary
national_animals = {}
#Read in the file using with statement
with open("national-animals.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through the lines of input_file
  for row in input_file:
    #Set country and animal to variables using .split() method
    country = row.split(",")[0]
    animal = row.strip().split(",")[1]
    #Set key and value
    national_animals[country] = animal
#Print dictionary
print(national_animals)
```
`r unhide()`

You may have noticed that the first __pair__ is `'Country': 'National Animal'`. This is the header of the file and we do not want to keep it. 

There are various ways to not include the header when __reading__ in a file. One straightforward method is to create your data and then remove the header. This can be carried out in different ways for different __data structures__:

- __List__: Subset to only include all the values except the first one
  - E.g `list = list[1:]`.
- __Dictionary__: Use the `del` __keyword__ to delete a pair.
  - E.g: `del dictionary[key]`.

Try this yourself or see the edited solution below.

`r hide("National animals 2 solution with del")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC2
#Create empty dictionary
national_animals = {}
#Read in the file using with statement
with open("national-animals.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through the lines of input_file
  for row in input_file:
    #Set country and animal to variables using .split() method
    country = row.split(",")[0]
    animal = row.strip().split(",")[1]
    #Set key and value
    national_animals[country] = animal
#Remove the pair from the header
del national_animals["Country"]
#Print dictionary
print(national_animals)
```
`r unhide()`

What if you what to automate this so you don't have to manually enter the __key__ from the first __pair__?

You can extract the first line of a file with the __method__ `.readline()`. You can then get the string of the first column of the first line with:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
fstring = open("national-animals.csv", 'r').readline().strip().split(",")[0]
```

This can then be used with `del`. I encourage you to attempt this before looking at the below solution.

`r hide("National animals 2 solution with del automated")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC2
#Create empty dictionary
national_animals = {}
#Read in the file using with statement
with open("national-animals.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  #Loop through the lines of input_file
  for row in input_file:
    #Set country and animal to variables using .split() method
    country = row.split(",")[0]
    animal = row.strip().split(",")[1]
    #Set key and value
    national_animals[country] = animal
#Get key from first line
fstring = open("national-animals.csv", 'r').readline().strip().split()[0]
#Remove the pair from the header
del national_animals[fstring]
#Print dictionary
print(national_animals)
```
`r unhide()`

There are many other ways to do this, but I will let you discover these yourself in your future python coding. You could also remove the header line with a text editor or bash before reading it in.

__Ensure__ your __dictionary__ __"national_animals"__ does not have the header information before continuing.

## NA challenge 3
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Giraffa_camelopardalis.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

__Print__ out the national animals of the following countries:

- __Bangladesh__
- __Nicaragua__
- __Marshall Islands__
- __Niger__

Use the __dictionary__ __"national_animals"__ and carry out this challenge in one __coding cell__.

`r hide("National animals 3 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC3
print(national_animals["Bangladesh"])
print(national_animals["Nicaragua"])
print(national_animals["Marshall Islands"])
print(national_animals["Niger"])
```
`r unhide()`

## NA challenge 4
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Iguana_iguana.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Create a __list__ of the animals using the __values__ from the __dictionary__ __"animals_list"__. Then __print__ the __list__.

Additionally, create and print a __set__ of the animals called __"animals_set"__. 

__Tip__: Looping through a __dictionary__ will provide the __key__ as the __loop variable__. This can be used to extract the __value__ from the __dictionary__. You can try the example code below.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Loop dictionary and print values
for key in national_animals:
  value = national_animals[key]
  print(value)
```

`r hide("National animals 4 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC4.1
#Create empty list
animals_list = []
#Loop through keys
for key in national_animals:
  animals_list.append(national_animals[key])
#Print list
print(animals_list)
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC4.2
#Create set form list
animals_set = set(animals_list)
#Print
print(animals_set)
```
`r unhide()`

## NA challenge 5
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Aquila nipalensis.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Carry out the below tasks with python coding.

1. Print out the 5th to 7th animals in __animals_list__.
2. Print out the first 3 animals in __animals_list__.
3. Print out the last 5 animals in __animals_list__.
4. Print out all the animals except the first 190 in __animals_list__.
4. Print out all the animals except the last 180 in __animals_list__.
5. How many more countries are there compared to the number of unique national animals?

`r hide("National animals 5 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC5
#5 to 7
print(animals_list[4:7])
#First 3
print(animals_list[:3])
#Last 5
print(animals_list[-5:])
#All except first 190
print(animals_list[190:])
#All except last 180
print(animals_list[:-180])
#How many more countries compared to unique national animals
print(len(national_animals) - len(animals_set))
```
`r unhide()`

## NA challenge 6
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Crocodylus_porosus.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Create a __dictionary__ where the __key__ is the animal and the __value__ is the number of countries it is a national animal for. Call it __"animal_popularity"__.

__Print__ __"animal_popularity"__.

`r hide("National animals 6 tip")`
You can count the number of times a __string__ appears as __value__ in a __list__ with `.count()`. Try out the below code.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Will give zero as there is no value that is just an "a"
print(animals_list.count("a"))
#Will give 19 as there are 19 countries with the Eagle as there national animal
print(animals_list.count("Eagle"))
```
`r unhide()`

`r hide("National animals 6 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC6
#Create empty dictionary
animal_popularity = {}
#Loop through animal set made in NAC4
for animal in animals_set:
  #Count the number of times the animal appears in the animal list made in NAC4
  animal_count = animals_list.count(animal)
  #Add animal and count to animal_popularity dictionary
  animal_popularity[animal] = animal_count
#Print
print(animal_popularity)
```
`r unhide()`

## NA challenge 7
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Panthera_leo.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

This challenge is difficult. Please, try your best to make a solution before looking at my solution. You can solve this with what you the __fuctions, methods__, etcs that you learn tin this course. Optionally, I encourage you to search online for help, this is what normal day to day bioinformatics involves.

Using __"animal_popularity"__ answer the question "What animal represents the most countries as their national animal?"

With this information print the statement "The most popular animal is the \<animal\> which represents \<country count\> countries as their national animal."

Do not simply look through the __dictionary__ __"animal_popularity"__. Create code that could be reused for any __dictionary__ containing __integer__ __values__.

`r hide("National animals 6 tip")`
First create 2 __variables__ to then be used in a __fo rloop__. Use an __if__ statement in your __for loop__.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
highest_count = 0
most_popular_animal = ""
```
`r unhide()`

`r hide("National animals 7 solution")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC7
#Set variable of highest count and most popular animal
highest_count = 0
most_popular_animal = ""
#Loop through animal set made in NAC4
for animal in animals_set:
  #If statement checking if animal count is greater than highest_count
  if animal_popularity[animal] > highest_count:
    #Set highest_count and most_popular_animal to current info in loop
    highest_count = animal_popularity[animal]
    most_popular_animal = animal
#Print statement
print("The most popular animal is the " + most_popular_animal + " which represents " +
      str(highest_count) + " countries as their national animal.")
```
`r unhide()`

If you looked for help online you may have found the solution in the below box.

`r hide("National animals 7 solution with online help")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC7 with online help
#Max value
max_value = max(animal_popularity.values())
#Max key
max_key = max(animal_popularity, key=animal_popularity.get)
#Print statement
print("The most popular animal is the " + max_key + " which represents " +
      str(max_value) + " countries as their national animal.")
```
`r unhide()`

## NA challenge 8
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Pteropus_medius.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

For the last challenge use the __dictionary__ __"animal_popularity"__ to __write__ to a new file called __"popular_national_animals.csv"__. 

Make sure this file has the following features:

1. The fields/columns are comma separated (`,`).
2. The first line is the header with the following text: "Animal,popularity_count"
3. There is a line for each animal with a count of 2 or more.
  - An example line would be: "Pelican,2"

`r hide("National animals 8 tip 1")`
Add `\n` to the end of your file lines so each entry is on a new line.
`r unhide()`

`r hide("National animals 7 solution with online help")`
```{python, eval=FALSE}
#NAC8
#Create file, open for writing, and put into data stream
with open("popular_national_animals.csv", 'w') as output_file:
  #Write header
  output_file.write("Animal,popularitycount\n")
  #Loop through animal set made in NAC4
  for animal in animals_set:
    #Determine if animal count is greater than 1
    if animal_popularity[animal] > 1:
      #Write line to file
      output_file.write(animal + "," + str(animal_popularity[animal]) + "\n")
```
`r unhide()`

## National animals conclusion
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/Gallus_gallus_domesticus.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Superlative! That is the end of the national animals exercise. Throughout it you have:

- __Read__ in a file and created a __dictionary__ with the data.
- Extracted __values__ using the __keys__ of a __dictionary__.
- Created a __list__ from the __values__ of a __dictionary__.
- Created a __set__ from a __list__.
- Extracted __values__ from a __list__.
- Created a __dictionary__ with __integer__ values.
- Discovered what is the most popular animal.
- Created a new file with the most popular animals.

One last set of exercises awaits you.
