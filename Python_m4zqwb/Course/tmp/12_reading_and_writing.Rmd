# Reading and writing files

<center>![](images/write_file.png){height=220px}</center>

Often we want to read from a data file, perform some task with the data, and write out
another file.

To read/write a file in Python we open a data stream using a statement such as:

(don't add this line to the script)
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(path_to_file, "open_mode") as input_file:
```

There are two parts to consider:

  - open(path_to_file, mode)
  
  - with(...`<input-file>`...) as input_file:
  
## 'open'
<center>![](images/open.png){height=220px}</center>

The `open` __function__ asks the Python interpreter to make a link to the specified file and open a data stream.
We need to specify the mode by which the file is opened.
The most common modes are:
 
 - 'w'   - WRITE: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be replaced by a new, empty file.
 - 'r'   - READ: Open an existing file for reading.
 - 'a'   - APPEND: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, new data will be added to the end of the existing file.
 
There are other modes but these three cover the majority of file tasks.

## 'with'

The `with` statement, which is wrapped around the `open` __function__, gives this data stream a variable name (input_file).
It also performs important 'under-the-hood' cleaning up that stops files from becoming corrupted.

## Read a data file

Open a new script in Gedit. Again add the location of our working directory and load the SeqIO library. 
Add the following to open a data stream to <b>read</b> the provided file 'patients_data.csv'.
Then add a `for` loop to print each line of the file.

Save the script as "script03.py" and run it from the terminal.

__Note__: Ensure `wd =` is set to your home directory.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
wd = "/pub14/tea/nsc201"
from Bio import SeqIO

with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  for row in input_file:
    print(row)
```

Run the script and the data from the file will be printed to the terminal window. We will learn to organise this output in a more usable way in the supplementary material).

## Write data to a file
<center>![](images/write.png){height=220px}</center>

Modify the script above to add a second data stream, opening a second file for *write* access.
We'll loop through the input_file. 
For each row in the input file, we prepend the line of data with the string "Study_2022,".
Then we write this new data line to the output file using the `.write()` __method__.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_modified.csv", 'w') as output_file:
    with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
        for row in input_file:
            #print(row)
            output_file.write("Study_2022," + row)
```

In the <b>terminal</b> window, run the following to view first few lines of the new "patients_modified.csv" file. You will
see that each row in the data now starts with the "Study_2022" string.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# In the terminal (not the Python script)
cd ~
head Python_course_data/patients_modified.csv
```

## Write out the filtered Undulate ray sequence data
Returning to our example data relating to the undulate ray, we have a list of sequence records (trimmed_sequences).
These have passed our filters and we now want to write out the FASTQ file so that it might be further analysed using another piece of software.

<b>Return to the script in Gedit that was concerned with the FastQ data (named script02.py).</b>

At the bottom of the script, we will open up a data stream to a new output file.
Then using SeqIO's built in `write` __method__ we will write out data, specifying we want a FASTQ format file:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/R_undulata_filtered_seqs.fastq", 'w') as output_file:
  SeqIO.write(trimmed_sequences, output_file, "fastq")
```  

This trimmed, filtered file would now be ready to go into whichever subsequent analysis was desired.

In your linux terminal list the contents of your "Python_course_data" directory to see that the newly created file exists.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls Python_course_data
```

## Recap

<center>![](./images/recap.webp){height=300px}</center>
To read or write files we need to open a data stream using the <b>with</b> and <b>open</b> functions. 

Each file can be opened in one of several modes; either <b>w</b>rite, <b>r</b>ead, or <b>a</b>ppend, depending on what you need to do. 

Once files are written to the disk they are available to use in further analyses or other pieces of software.
