## Introduction to commands and scripts
There are two important components to programming in Python; the commands that are committed by the user, and the interpreter which receives and implements the commands.

Each command can be thought of as a single instruction and these can be added together into a series of steps, called a script. 
Think about how a cooking recipe is often presented:

1) Break a few eggs
2) Make an omelette

These are two distinct *commands*, but together they form a *script* for how to transform raw eggs into an omelette.

In Python we can either issue commands one at a time to the Python interpreter or we can put them into a file and submit the whole script at once.

## Issuing commands directly to the interpreter

Open up the Python interpreter in the terminal window of the VNC with the following command. We are using Python version 3, the current version.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
python3
```

Python has opened correctly if you see the following message (or very similar):

```{python, eval=FALSE}
Python 3.9.6 | packaged by conda-forge (default, Jul  11 2021, 12:28:51) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>  
```

The ">>>" and blinking cursor shows that the Python command line interface is ready to receive commands. Try using the **print** command as shown below. 

Python is very particular about braces/brackets and quote marks.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("Hello, world!")

print("I'm excited to be learning some Python!")
```

Get the *current working directory* using Python as we will need this for our scripts later.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import os

os.getcwd()
```

This will return something like: '/pub39/tea/nsc206' (your number will be different though).

Highlight this filepath text, including the quote marks, right click and 'copy'.

So far we have issued simple instructions to Python but if we had lots of complex commands it would very quickly become cumbersome to type them in or to run it repeatedly.

Throughout the workshop, we will build up more complex scripts and submit them to the interpreter to be run all at once.

## A note on indentation

  Indentation refers to any spaces or tab characters at the beginning of a line
  of code. Indentation helps readability of code by helping to define code blocks
  dedicated to a single purpose. However, indentation in Python is *mandatory*
  and the interpreter will give an error if the indentation is wrong.
  
  The code editor we are going to be using today attempts to *auto* indent code but we still
  need to take care that the level of indentation in the script matches
  that in the workbook *exactly*.
  
## Tabs vs spaces
  There is an active
  debate about whether tabs or spaces are more appropriate for indentation. 
  
  For reference, one tab = 4 spaces.
  
  You can use either tabs or space,  but you cannot use them interchangeably!

Do not enter the below, this is just an illustration of how three levels of TAB indentation looks in a script.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Zero level of indentation
  # One level of indentation
    # Two levels of identation
# Zero level of indentation
```
