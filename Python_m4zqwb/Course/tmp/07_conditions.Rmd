# Python Conditions: 'if' and 'else' statements

A powerful feature of most programming languages is the ability to compare values/**variables** and to make decisions based upon the outcome.
This type of behaviour is achieved using *logical conditions*.

The conditions allowed depend on the type of data you are comparing.
For example, you cannot use greater than or less than on **string variables** directly (although you could compare their lengths).

**Python supports the following logical conditions:**

-   Equals: `a == b`

-   Does not equal: `a != b`

-   Less than: `a < b`

-   Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

-   Greater than: `a > b`

-   Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

Try the following:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
a = "ATTGCG"
b = "AGCGAT"

a==b
len(a) == len(b)
```

These logical conditions are most typically used in **if** statements.

## If statements

By testing whether certain comparisons evaluate as either **True** or **False**, we can change the flow of our programs.

An **if statement** is a programming statement which acts like a switch.
If the statement is **True**, the switch is activated.
If the statement is **False**, the switch remains inactivated.

A generic **if statement** using pseudocode would have the following structure: <br>

1.  If a condition is met:

    2.  Perform a task

## If else statements

We can also include an action for when the condition has not been met using **else**.
The **else statement** works in conjunction with the **if** and offers a different action if the condition evaluated to **False**.

1.  If a condition is met:
    -   Perform a task
2.  Else:
    -   Do something else

For example, we might have a string of nucleotide data which we want to move through, translating any thymine (T) bases into uracil (U).
The other three bases (A, C, and G) do not require any processing.

The **if** and **else statements** to do this would look something like (again, using pseudocode):

1.  If the current nucleotide is "T":
    -   Print "U"
2.  Else:
    -   Print the current nucleotide

We will explore using loops to move through data more in the next chapter.

## Recap

**If** and **else statements** can be used to make decisions in our programs by comparing values.
This might be to check if two strings are the same, two lists contain the same number of items, or a string of nucleotide data has 100 or more bases.
We can think of them as switches.

Often we need to make these **if**/**else** comparisons for every item in a data structure and to do this we can use loops.
