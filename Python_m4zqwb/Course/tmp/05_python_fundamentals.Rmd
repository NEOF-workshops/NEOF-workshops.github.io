# Python Fundamentals

<center>![](./images/python_fundamentals.png){height=200px}</center>

This chapter covers some of the fundamental concepts of scripting in Python.
An understanding of how to use __operators__, __variables__, and __functions__ will
give a good grounding in how the language works and allow you to develop
your own methods and code.

You definitely do not need to memorise all the information here as all of these
concepts will be explored more in the rest of the tutorial. The best way to
learn how various aspects of the Python language work is by *doing* rather
than by *reading*. 

Consider
coming back to this page later if you want to remind yourself of how a
particular operator works or how to define a __function__.

<b> For each of the following sections of example code, enter them directly into the Python interpreter and press enter after each line.</b>

## Operators

<center>![](./images/operators.svg){height=200px}</center>
Python allows the use of the usual arithmetic operators and follows the traditional rules of mathematical precedence (BODMAS). 

The maths operators are:

* `+` (addition)
    
* `-` (subtraction)
    
* `*` (multiplication)
    
* `/` (division)
    
* `**` (power)
    
* `//`(integer division)
  
## Comments

<center>![](./images/comment.jpg){height=200px}</center>

It is often useful to include human-readable comments in your scripts and code.
Comments in Python are indicated by the hash symbol (`#`). 
Anything to the right of the hash is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.
When working through the workbook there is no need to add the comments into the commands or scripts.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# This line is a comment

print("This section will print") # This section is ignored
```

## Variables

__Variables__ are used to store information which can then be referenced or manipulated later. 
They are also useful to label data with a descriptive name which is easily read by a human. 
You can think of a __variable__ as a 'container' to hold a piece of information. 
  
__Variables__ are assigned a value using the equals (`=`) character.

__Variable names__:

- Start with either a letter or an underscore
- Only contain alphanumeric characters (and underscores)
- Are case sensitive.

Python supports several classes (or types) of __variables__ including __strings__, __integers__, __floats__, and __booleans__.

### Strings

<center>![](./images/string.png){height=200px}</center>

__Strings__ are used to store alphanumeric text. A __string__ is defined by enclosing the text with either single or double quotes.
    
Enter the following into the Python terminal, pressing enter after each line. Here we define two __string variables__, and then retrieve them again by using their name, or identifier.
    
```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA_string = "GCACAAACC"
amino_acids = "ARG VAL TRP"
  
DNA_string
amino_acids
```
  
### Integers  

__Integers__ are used to store whole numbers.
These should not be declared with quote marks otherwise they will be stored as a string.
  
Enter the following:
    
```{python, eval=FALSE}
my_int = 7
  
my_int
```
  
### Floats (floating point numbers)

<center>![](./images/float.png){height=200px}</center>

**Floating point numbers** are used to store real numbers (I.e. a number written with a decimal point dividing the integer and the fractional parts).

Enter the following:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
my_float = 7.0001
another_float = 345.765
yet_another_float = -5.423e+19

my_float
another_float
yet_another_float
```
  
### Booleans

<center>![](./images/bool.png){height=200px}</center>


**Booleans** are a special type of variable than can represent one of
two values: *True* or *False*. 
You can compare any two values in Python and get a result of either __True__ or __False__.

- To check if two values are equal we use double equals: `==`
- To check if two values are not equal we use: `!=`
- Greater than (`>`) or less than (`<`) also work.

Enter the following:
    
```{python, eval=FALSE}
a_bool = 10>9
a_bool

another_bool = "ATGCA" != "ATGCA"
another_bool

yet_another_bool = 9>42
yet_another_bool
```
  
## Classes of variable

Every __variable__ in Python has a __class__. These are the characteristics we described above:

- __String__ (`<class 'str'>`)
- __Integer__ (`<class 'int'>`)
- __Float__ (`<class 'float'>`)
- __Boolean__ (`<class 'bool'>`)

Unlike some other languages, you do not need to tell Python which __class__ a __variable__ should have. 
Python will try to figure it out based on the value assigned.

You can check the __class__ of a __variable__ by passing it to the `type()` __function__:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
variable1 = "a piece of text"
type(variable1)

variable2 = 5
type(variable2)

variable3 = 7.0001
type(variable3)

variable4 = True
type(variable4)
```
  
## Transforming variables

<center>![](./images/transform.png){height=200px}</center>

__Variables__ can be transformed from one type to another provided the value can be coerced into the new data type (I.e. you could not transform a  __string__ of text to a floating point number). 

To transform a __float__ to an __integer__ using the `int()` __function__ (note the loss of precision):
    
```{python, eval=FALSE}
a_float = 17.45

int(a_float)
```
    
To transform an __integer__ to a __string__ using the `str()` __function__:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
an_integer = 783473
str(an_integer)
```

You can also transform to a floating point using `float()`.
  
## Functions and methods

<center>![](./images/function.jpg){height=200px}</center>

__Functions__ and __methods__ are groups of instructions that together perform a specific task. 
This may be a task that you need to run repeatedly on your data and by storing these instructions in a single __function__, you only need to enter the code once and simply re-use it each time. 
A __function__ returns a value after it has performed the specific task.

### Running a function
A __function__ is a distinct piece of code which requires data to be sent to it in order to run.
To run a __function__ you need to give the name of the __function__ followed by a pair of braces with the desired input within the braces. 

We have already been using some __functions__: the `int()` and `str()` __functions__.

For example, we might want to find the length of a __string__ of nucleotides.
In this instance, we can use the built-in `len()` __function__ on the __string__:

(use any __string__ of 'ACGT' you like, no need to copy this one exactly!)

```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA = "ACGTGTTATATGCGCGTTAGTGTAGTCGATC"

# print the length of the string
len(DNA)
```

### Running a method

__Methods__ are very similar to __functions__ in that they process an input in some manner.
They differ in that __methods__ are associated with a particular data __class__ (string, for example) and are called via the data itself. 

__Methods__ are called using a different syntax; the __variable__ is followed by __"."__ and the name of the __method__ with a pair of braces.

First let's try a couple of __methods__ associated with manipulation of __string__ data:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# define a string called sequencers
sequencers = "illumina,oxford_nanopore,pac-bio"

# the upper() method converts string variables to uppercase
sequencers.upper()

# split() chops a string up wherever the specified sub-string occurs (comma in this case)
sequencers.split(",")
```

We can also use built-in __methods__ for some simple analysis using the "DNA" __string__ generated earlier. For example, the built in `count()` __method__ can be used to count the number of each nucleotide in the string.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
DNA.count("A")
DNA.count("C")
DNA.count("G")
DNA.count("T")
```

By using the `len()` __function__ and the `count()` __method__, we can calculate the GC content of the DNA sequence:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
## count the number of G and C in the sequence
G_total = DNA.count("G")
C_total = DNA.count("C")

# calculate the percentage of the sequence that is GC
(G_total + C_total)/len(DNA)*100
```

## Recap

<center>![](./images/recap.webp){height=300px}</center>

We have described and tried some of the major types of __variables__ which are used in Python. 

All __variables__ have a __class__ and this can determine which __functions__ and __methods__ we can apply to them. 

We have also explored __functions__ (`function_name(variable)`) and __methods__ (`variable_name.function_name()`), and can now apply them to __variables__.

There was lots of information in this chapter. You don't need to memorise it. Please refer back to this chapter at any point.
