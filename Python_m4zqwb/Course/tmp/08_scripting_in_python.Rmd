# Scripting in Python

At this point we are going to stop issuing commands directly to the Python interpreter and instead build up a Python **script**.

In the terminal window, exit from the interactive Python session:

    quit()

## Open a plain text editor

In the terminal window, run the following to open up an instance of the '**Gedit**' text editor.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
gedit &
```

**Gedit** is a 'plain text editor' which means it will not add any hidden characters or formatting to the document. It is important to not to edit code in a word processor such as Microsoft Word.

You should still have your current working directory on the clipboard. (If you don't, run `os.getcwd()` in the terminal window and copy it again)

Paste this into the **Gedit** window and define a **variable** `wd` (working directory) using a version of the following (your filepath will be slightly different).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
wd = '/pub39/tea/nsc014'
print("Hello, world!")
print(wd)
```

Save the **script** into the directory of your username (something like nsc014) and name it 'script01.py'.

See the image below to make sure it is being saved in the correct place. This is important because we need to tell Python where the **script** is.

## Running a script from the terminal

Return to the **terminal** window. You may need to clear some text from the terminal leftover from when we launched Gedit; do this with **ctrl + c**.

Run the Python script we have just saved with the following:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
python3 script01.py
```

This process of editing the script file in **Gedit**, saving, and running the script in the terminal will form the basis of the rest of the tutorial.

Return to the Python **script** and comment (`#`) out the two print statements. We will continue working in this same script file in the next section.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
wd = "/pub39/tea/nsc014"
#print("Hello, world!")
#print(wd)
```
