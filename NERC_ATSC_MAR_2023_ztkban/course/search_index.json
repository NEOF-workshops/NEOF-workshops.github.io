This is the reason it looks so nice. Real data from a sequencing machine will unfortunately not look as good and will require quality trimming and filtering. Generally even if data does look very nice we would carry out quality control to get rid of any poor data that is masked by the very good data. However, for the purposes of time we will not look at this for this dataset.

We will be looking at Bacillus cereus MiSeq data that can be found in the following link: https://ccb.jhu.edu/gage_b/datasets/index.html (no need to download). For the purposes of the tutorial I subsampled the reads down to a more manageable 50,000 pairs, normally read data will not come in such round numbers. 4.1 B. cereus: raw fastQC Below are the links to the fastQC reports for the forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads of the B. cereus sequencing data.

We are therefore going to quality trim and filter the data. Unfortunately data straight from the sequencer always needs quality control. 4.2 B. cereus: Quality control Quality control generally comes in two forms: Trimming: This is directly cutting off bits of sequence. This is typical in the form of trimming off low quality bases from the end of reads and trimming off adapters at the start of reads. Filtering: This occurs when entire reads are removed. A typical occurrence of this is when a read is too small as we do not want reads below a certain length. The data was quality controlled with trimmomatic. A sliding window size of 4 with a quality threshold of Q20 was used. Additionally, a minimum length of 50 was used for filtering. 4.3 B. cereus: trimmed fastQC Below are the links to the fastQC reports for the trimmed forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads of the B. cereus sequencing data.

Yes No In R2, do the IQRs and/or whiskers drop below Q28 in the \"Per base sequence quality\" graph? Yes No In R2, do the IQRs drop below Q28 in the \"Per base sequence quality\" graph? Yes No What is the most common \"mean sequence quality\" for the reads in R2 (see the peak of the \"Per sequence quality scores\" graph)? 0 37 250-251 What is the total count of overrepresented sequences in R1? 0 37 250-251 What is the most common base length range for R2 (see the peak of the \"Sequence Length Distribution\" graph)? 0 37 250-251 4.4 B. cereus: summary Some things to note: The amount of reads has significantly decreased due to quality control. This is expected, however this will need to be taken into account. If you do not have enough reads for the downstream analysis you will need to be less stringent on the trimming or filtering. What is the minimum number of reads required for downstream analysis? Unfortunately this depends on the specific analysis at hand. For genome assemblies generally the rule of thumb is you want at least 20 times as much bases in the reads as would be in the final assembly (based on the genome size of the organisms). R2 quality is still worse than R1 quality. Again this is normal. The quality controlled reads of the reverse reads still drop below Q28 towards the end of the reads. This is pretty typical. You could be more stringent but as previously mentioned you may be removing too many reads. The overrepresented sequences, which were Illumina adapters needed for sequencing, were removed by trimmomatic. This is good as we don't need/want them any more. Note: If you are getting data from a sequencing centre they will have most likely removed the adapters already. Been sure to check they are not appearing in the Overrepresented sequences or the Adapter Content section of the fastqc report after trimming before continuing. If adapters are present you can use Cutadapt to remove them: https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html "],["05-shotgun_metagenomic_qc.html", "Chapter 5 Whole shotgun metagenomics 5.1 Metagenome: raw fastqc 5.2 Metagenome: trimmed fastqc 5.3 Metagenome: summary", " Chapter 5 Whole shotgun metagenomics Now you will carry out Quality checking of a metagenome shotgun study.

What may be causing the weird GC content at the start of the reads? The \"Per sequence GC content\" has a weird peak. Why might this be? 5.2 Metagenome: trimmed fastqc The metagenome sequencing data was quality controlled with filtering and trimming.

Is the number of quality controlled reads above 60,000? Yes No Does the quality for either R1 or R2 drop below Q24 (Including the whiskers)? Yes No Is the weird GC content, seen in the raw data, still at the start of the read? Yes No Does the \"Per sequence GC content\" still have a weird peak? Yes No 5.3 Metagenome: summary In this case it helps to know the adapter sequence, used for the Illumina sequencing, was Nextera. Nextera is decent but I and others online have experienced it has a slight bias. It prefers to ligate to certain sequence patterns, this bias is then shown as the GC content bias at the start of reads. Fortunately, the rest of the GC content is fine. In previous tests I have trimmed off the first 20bp to remove this bias and not removed the first 20bp. I found there was little difference in the downstream results for the two methods. As for the weird \"Per sequence GC content\" peak, We must remember that the metagenome sample contains many different organisms with different GC contents. Therefore a flat GC peak would be expected. "],["06-16S_qc.html", "Chapter 6 16S rRNA Metagenetics QC 6.1 16S: fastQC 6.2 16S: summary", " Chapter 6 16S rRNA Metagenetics QC It is useful to use fastqc to check the quality and features of a 16S rRNA dataset. However, both QIIME2 and MOTHUR have their own methods for quality control that should be used instead of normal trimming. The dataset we will be investigating can be found in the following link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRR2081030 6.1 16S: fastQC Below are the links to the fastQC reports for the trimmed forward (1) and reverse (2) reads of the 16S sequencing data. B_cereus_trimmed_R1_fastqc.html B_cereus_trimmed_R2_fastqc.html Investigate the reports. We have looked at a good amount of fastQC reports so we will skip MCQs this time. 6.2 16S: summary Looking at the reports you may be worried by its appearance, however this is normal for 16S rRNA data. Some explanations for the features are: The base quality of R2 is very low towards the end. For most 16S rRNA studies the paired reads overlap and so poor quality bases at the end of R1 are corrected by the overlapping R2 reads and vice versa. The \"Per base sequence content\" is heavily biased. This again is normal as we are targeting a specific region within the genome, a 16S rRNA region. This means a lot of the sequences will share very similar content. The fact we are targeting a specific region also makes the \"Per sequence GC content\", \"Sequence duplication levels\", and \"overrepresented sequences\" look worrying and warnings are given. These warnings are designed to help with whole genome data and so they are not useful in this circumstance. These features show that it is important to understand what your data contains and what analyses you will be carrying out with the data.

This means if you have 100 sets of paired reads you can look at 2 MultiQC htmls rather than 200 FastQC reports. I say 2 MultiQC htmls because it is best to put the forward reads into 1 MultiQC report and the reverse reads into another.
