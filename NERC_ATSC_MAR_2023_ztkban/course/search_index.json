This is the reason it looks so nice. Real data from a sequencing machine will unfortunately not look as good and will require quality trimming and filtering.

We are therefore going to quality trim and filter the data. Unfortunately data straight from the sequencer always needs quality control. 4.2 B. cereus: Quality control Quality control generally comes in two forms: Trimming: This is directly cutting off bits of sequence. This is typical in the form of trimming off low quality bases from the end of reads and trimming off adapters at the start of reads. Filtering: This occurs when entire reads are removed. A typical occurrence of this is when a read is too small as we do not want reads below a certain length. The data was quality controlled with trimmomatic. A sliding window size of 4 with a quality threshold of Q20 was used. Additionally, a minimum length of 50 was used for filtering. 4.3 B. cereus: trimmed fastQC Below are the links to the fastQC reports for the trimmed forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads of the B. cereus sequencing data.

This is expected, however this will need to be taken into account. If you do not have enough reads for the downstream analysis you will need to be less stringent on the trimming or filtering. What is the minimum number of reads required for downstream analysis? Unfortunately this depends on the specific analysis at hand. For genome assemblies generally the rule of thumb is you want at least 20 times as much bases in the reads as would be in the final assembly (based on the genome size of the organisms). R2 quality is still worse than R1 quality. Again this is normal. The quality controlled reads of the reverse reads still drop below Q28 towards the end of the reads. This is pretty typical. You could be more stringent but as previously mentioned you may be removing too many reads. The overrepresented sequences, which were Illumina adapters needed for sequencing, were removed by trimmomatic. This is good as we don't need/want them any more. Note: If you are getting data from a sequencing centre they will have most likely removed the adapters already. Been sure to check they are not appearing in the Overrepresented sequences or the Adapter Content section of the fastqc report after trimming before continuing. If adapters are present you can use Cutadapt to remove them: https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html "],["05-shotgun_metagenomic_qc.html", "Chapter 5 Whole shotgun metagenomics 5.1 Metagenome: raw fastqc 5.2 Metagenome: trimmed fastqc 5.3 Metagenome: summary", " Chapter 5 Whole shotgun metagenomics Now you will carry out Quality checking of a metagenome shotgun study.

Yes No Is the weird GC content, seen in the raw data, still at the start of the read? Yes No Does the \"Per sequence GC content\" still have a weird peak? Yes No 5.3 Metagenome: summary In this case it helps to know the adapter sequence, used for the Illumina sequencing, was Nextera. Nextera is decent but I and others online have experienced it has a slight bias. It prefers to ligate to certain sequence patterns, this bias is then shown as the GC content bias at the start of reads. Fortunately, the rest of the GC content is fine. In previous tests I have trimmed off the first 20bp to remove this bias and not removed the first 20bp. I found there was little difference in the downstream results for the two methods. As for the weird \"Per sequence GC content\" peak, We must remember that the metagenome sample contains many different organisms with different GC contents. Therefore a flat GC peak would be expected.

However, both QIIME2 and MOTHUR have their own methods for quality control that should be used instead of normal trimming. The dataset we will be investigating can be found in the following link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRR2081030 6.1 16S: fastQC Below are the links to the fastQC reports for the trimmed forward (1) and reverse (2) reads of the 16S sequencing data.

We have looked at a good amount of fastQC reports so we will skip MCQs this time. 6.2 16S: summary Looking at the reports you may be worried by its appearance, however this is normal for 16S rRNA data. Some explanations for the features are: The base quality of R2 is very low towards the end. For most 16S rRNA studies the paired reads overlap and so poor quality bases at the end of R1 are corrected by the overlapping R2 reads and vice versa. The \"Per base sequence content\" is heavily biased. This again is normal as we are targeting a specific region within the genome, a 16S rRNA region. This means a lot of the sequences will share very similar content. The fact we are targeting a specific region also makes the \"Per sequence GC content\", \"Sequence duplication levels\", and \"overrepresented sequences\" look worrying and warnings are given. These warnings are designed to help with whole genome data and so they are not useful in this circumstance. These features show that it is important to understand what your data contains and what analyses you will be carrying out with the data.

The dataset we will look at today is from a study by Doble et al. 2019 on tropical fish communities from Lake Tanganyika. The study's authors collected water eDNA samples from sites along the shore of Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. Samples where then filtered, extracted and made into individual libraries using a two-step PCR method to attach indexes and Illumina adapters. Four different primer sets were used to assess the community structure of fishes in Lake Tanganyika. We will examine the two shorter primer sets today: MiFish‐U (Miya et al. 2015) these primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene. 12S‐V5 (Riaz et al. 2011) these primers target a different part of the 12S region. Both these primer sets target sections of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. The 12S gene occupies 1/16th of the mitochondrial genome. It is the mitochondrial homologue of the prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic nuclear 18S ribosomal RNAs. Both genes were sequenced using a single Illumina MiSeq 300 cycle sequencing run (2x150bp paired end sequencing).

These encompas only a few methods to look at biodiversity data. 13.1 Alpha diversity The alpha diversity plots will use the following metrics. 1. Shannon's diversity index A measure of diversity where a higher number means higher diversity. Shannon's index accounts for the abundance and evenness of the features present. If richness and evenness increase the diversity score increases. Values can range from one (in case of a single dominant species) to the total number of all species (in case of all species having equal abundance). Equation: \\[ H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i lnp_i \\] H = Shannon diversity index pi = is the proportion of species i S = Number of species 2. Simpson diversity index A measure of diversity based on number of features present and the relative abundance of each feature. If richness and evenness increase the diversity score increases. The values range from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (infinite diversity). Equation: \\[ D = 1 - {\\sum_{i=1}^{S} {p_i} ^{2}} \\] D = Simpson diversity index pi = is the proportion of species i S = Number of species 13.1.1 Alpha diversity box plots Below are alpha diversity box plots grouped by the sites. 13.1.2 Alpha diversity MCQs Attempt the following MCQs Which site has the the lowest diversity? Aquarium Site 2 Site 10 Which site, of the options provided, has the highest diversity?

Aquarium Site 2 Site 10 How many sites have a median Shannon value greater than 2.0? 2 3 4 How many sites have a median Simpson value less than 0.6? 2 3 4 13.2 Beta diversity Beta diversity compares the difference in diversity between two sites, or to put it another way it calculates the number of species that are not the same in the two sites. 13.2.1 Beta diveristy NMDS Below is the NMDS (Non-metric MultiDimenstional Scaling) plot using Bray-Curtis distances. The closer the points are the more similar they are in terms of taxonomic composition. Bray-Curtis info The Bray-Curtis metric is a dissimilarity measure that can quantify the level of difference between two samples. Two identical samples would have a Bray-Curtis measure of 0 (i.e. they have 0 dissimilarity). There are 2 versions but the one used by QIIME2 looks at the number of features shared by the 2 samples. Equation: \\[ CBC = 1 – (\\frac{2c} {a + b}) \\] c = # features present in both samples a = # features present in sample a b = # features present in sample b In general the samples do seem to cluster roughly by site in the NMDS plot. 13.3 Taxonomic composition The below plot displays the relative abundances of the different families detected in the samples. We can see that the five aquarium samples contain mostly Cichlidae sequences, apart from a very small number of unassigned (NA) and misassigned (there were only cichlid fish in the aquarium) sequences. Site 11 has more than 50% unassigned sequences in all three replicate samples. All of the samples containing &gt; 10% Procatopodidae sequences are grouped together in the NMDS plot (especially sites 19 &amp; 20, but also two samples from site 2, and the one sample from site 18), suggesting this may be in part driving the observed patterns of community similarity.
