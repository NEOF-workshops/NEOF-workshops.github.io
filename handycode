#Create one page html book
#Add the following to _output.yml
bookdown::html_book:
  split_by: none
  css: style.css
  toc: false
#Run the following command in the book dir to render
bookdown::render_book("01-XX.Rmd", "bookdown::html_book", output_dir = "one_file_book")

#MCQ example
#MCQ example
```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("A1", "A2", answer="A3")
```
1. Question? `r longmcq(opts_p)`

#template
```{r, echo = FALSE}
opts_p <- c("", "", "")
```
 `r longmcq(opts_p)`


#Expandable help box example
`r hide("Title")`
Contents
`r unhide()`



#HTMLS found in "_book" directory
#Need to run render_book command to update any changes

#Easiest way I find is to have 1 page per chapter
#File names need to start with a number to show order 01-, 02-, 03- etc

#YAML files you may need to change
# _bookdown.yml : Good to change the "book_filename:"
# _output.yml : Good to change the "before:" text to what you want
	Additionally I have turned off a lot of things so readers do not have a lot of buttons I don't want them to have
	I have "split_by:" set to "rmd" so there is a html page for each rmd file
	This seems to be the best option for our purposes
	Can't seem to make just one html file without everything go into one long page

#Best thing seems to be to be to split by rmarkdowns
#This will name htmls so the htmls and rmds have the same suffix
#go to _output.yml and ensure the following is in
bookdown::gitbook:
  split_by: rmd
#To make 1 html
#go to _output.yml and ensure the following is in
bookdown::gitbook:
  split_by: none
