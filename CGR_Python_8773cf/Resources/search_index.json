Download zipped directory 1.8 Anaconda navigator If you want to use Anaconda/mamba on your own desktop I suggest using Anaconda navigator as it is a gui version of anaconda/mamba. Anaconda navigator overview Download page Anaconda and Jupyter notebook are installed by default in anaconda navigator. To install Biopython (required for the workshop materials) in Anaconda navigator: Go to “Environments” in Anaconda navigator. Click on “base (root)”. Change the selection from “Installed” to “Not installed”. Find Biopython and tick its box, then press apply. Follow the install instructions. Now you can go back to Home and launch Jupyter Notebook. Note: The Jupyter notebook installed with Anaconda navigator may be a newer version than the one used in the workshop and therefore look different.
