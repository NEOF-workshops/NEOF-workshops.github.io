Gemmell 2025-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is a well established method of determining the bacterial taxonomic composition of microbiomes. This has been used for human and animal body sites, soil, sewage, clouds, deserts, permafrost and many other environments. This course will give you the ability to describe the advantages and disadvantages of 16S rRNA sequencing, and analyse 16S rRNA datasets with the QIIME2 bioinformatics platform. Sessions will start with a brief presentation followed by self-paced computer practicals guided by this online interactive book. This book will contain theory and practice code. Multiple choice questions will guide the interpretation of results. At the end of the course learners will be able to: Utilise and understand the use of QIIME2 with 16S rRNA data. Import sequencing data and metadata into QIIME2 artifacts. Cluster and denoise 16S sequences with DADA2. Assign taxonomies to ASVs and produce a phylogenetic tree. Evaluate and normalise sequencing depth across their samples. Produce alpha and beta diversity metrics and statistics. Carry out differential abundance analysis.

"],["02-Background.html", "Chapter 2 Background 2.1 16S rRNA 2.2 ITS and other possible marker genes 2.3 Amplicon sequencing", " Chapter 2 Background One of the most common aims of metagenomic analyses is to quantify the composition and diversity of a community (usually a community of prokaryotes). This can be done in several ways. A common approach is high-throughput amplicon sequencing, usually of a region of the bacterial 16S SSU rRNA gene. In the amplicon sequencing approach, amplicons act as ‘tags’ identifying the different bacterial species present in the sample. These can be both identified and quantified to describe the composition of the bacterial community (also called metagenetics or metaprofiling). In this workshop, we will analyse amplicon sequencing data, obtained by amplification of the variable region 4 of the 16S gene, using primer 515FB-806RB (Caporaso et al, 2011). The sequences were obtained from the Illumina MiSeq platform, 2x250bp reads, and the analysis process will be based on the software package QIIME2 (\"Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology\", https://qiime2.org). We will explore the bacterial populations sampled at various locations in the University of Liverpool's Bioscience building: toilets and corridors from different floors. A different approach to metagenetics/amplicons sequencing is shotgun metagenomic sequencing, where the whole genomic content of a sample is sequenced. In this approach, whole genomes, rather than just representative amplicons, are sequenced (shotgun metagenomics). This DNA can be assembled, or the source of the reads can be identified and quantified in a broadly similar way to 16S analysis. This is not covered in the workshop but we (NEOF) do have a Shotgun Metagenomic workshop. Please check our training page to see if registration is open for our next Shotgun metagenomics course. 2.1 16S rRNA 16S ribosomal RNA is a structural RNA which is a component of the prokaryotic ribosome. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis, therefore all prokaryotes have at least a 16S rRNA gene that codes for the 16S ribosomal RNA. The 16S rRNA gene is utilised in reconstructing phylogenies due to its slow rate of evolution, its size and its functional constancy. If the function of 16S rRNA changed then the cell could not synthesise proteins correctly and so will not survive. The 16S rRNA gene is ~1,500bp long and consists of 9 variable regions separated by conserved regions. The variable regions evolve at a faster rate allowing differentiation between bacterial taxa. The conserved regions evolve at a slower rate which allows areas to carry out universal amplification on the gene, allowing for amplicon sequencing. The nine variable regions are generally called V1, V2, V3 etc. Secondary structure of 16S rRNA of Esherichia coli (Yarza et al, 2014) 2.2 ITS and other possible marker genes It is very common to perform analysis with marker genes other than 16S, e.g. to study communities of fungi, insects or other eukaryote species. From the perspective of the bioinformatics analysis, the same overall pipeline can be used for most of the marker genes. ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) is a commonly used marker alternative to 16S. QIIME2 can be used to analyse ITS with a few steps and commands required which are unnecessary for 16S rRNA data. In this tutorial, locations will be highlighted where you should consider a pipeline variation if you are using ITS. In general, we recommend searching the literature so you can be aware of the state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of your marker of interest. 2.3 Amplicon sequencing The use of high-throughput amplicon-sequencing has proven to be powerful and accurate for microbial community analysis. It is currently the preferred choice used to investigate biological communities (bacterial or eukaryotic) in many samples and conditions. Some of the reasons for this method's popularity are: It is relatively easy to perform. It can be performed with many samples. It is relatively fast and cheap. On the negative side, there are many steps which may potentially introduce biases in the final result: Experimental design, sampling, storage and DNA extraction methods are known to potentially reduce the initial bacterial population processed and sequenced. Any reagent used may add exogenous bacterial population to the samples (potentially contaminating or changing the initial bacterial amount). Several papers discuss how the PCR protocol used for the amplification of the DNA material may affect the final results (such as the creation of chimeric sequences or by preferentially amplifying certain bacterial species). The choice of sequencing platform may result in the identification of different species in the same samples by having its own characteristic error-profile. From the bioinformatics perspective, the length of the sequences, and the pipeline used for the analysis are also able to add variability to the final results. The identification of the species in the samples can be affected by the quality and completeness of the database used for the analysis. Additionally, it may become less precise at lower taxonomy levels such as ‘genus’ and ‘species’ (Hugerth and Andersson, 2017). All these aspects need to be taken into account in the discussion of the results. Above shows a representation of amplicon sequencing. Different species are shown as different colours, with the indication of which species are in the site under investigation. Some species may be excluded from the sequencing because they are: Missed by the sampling methods (purple dots) Lost during the sample preparation (outside green square) Lost by the extraction technique (outside green square) Not amplified in the PCR step (outside red square) Representation of the number of sequences obtained for a sample, showing that increasing the number of sequences increases the probability to retrieve low-abundant species in the samples. The main purpose for this analysis is to infer the number and type of species in the initial sampling site by the abundance of the sequences obtained by the sequencing experiment. In order to do this effectively, the use of mock communities and negative controls is strongly suggested to evaluate the effect of any possibly introduced bias. Additionally, normalisation of the data is absolutely necessary to compare the diversity between sample groups.

In the following practical we will use the QIIME2 version released on October 2024 (given the active development on the tool this may not be the most recent release at the time of this workshop). If you want to install QIIME2 on your own machine, please refer to: https://library.qiime2.org/quickstart/amplicon 3.1 Artifacts The QIIME2 pipeline produces and uses artifact files. These contain data and metadata and may be of two types: result or visualisation. Result files (.qza): This file type contains the results of a method, which accepts other artifacts and specific settings as input, in order to apply a procedure creating a new artifact (e.g. loading sequences, error correction, alpha- or beta-diversity). Visualisation files (.qzv): This file type contains the results of a specific procedure to obtain an object that can only be used to visualize the results. These files can be loaded into the following web-site https://view.qiime2.org, where the interactive visualisations can be viewed. Please note that only chrome and Firefox are supported by this QIIME2 view website. 3.2 Workflow The steps for the analysis are listed below. Representation of the steps proposed for the analysis (Source) Prepare the sequence dataset Remove PCR primers Amplicon Sequence Variants identification Assign a taxonomic classification to each ASV Train naive-classifier for assignment Taxonomy assignment of the identified ASVs Make a phylogeny tree for the ASVs Alignment of the ASV representative sequences Masking low quality alignment Creating the un-rooted phylogenetic tree Creating the rooted phylogenetic tree Summarise the taxonomy data for each sample and plot results Estimate and plot alpha diversity Estimate and plot beta diversity Differential abundance analysis 3.3 Prepare the sequence dataset You will be using a raw dataset as the tutorial data. It still includes low quality sequences, Illumina sequencing adapters as well as PCR primers. Before proceeding with the analysis, it is a good strategy to investigate the quality of the sequences. The PCR primers used for the amplification may have degenerate positions (required for annealing to the large variety of species in the samples). This adds 'random' variability outside the target region. These unknown sequences may affect the subsequent taxonomy identification as well as the error-correction step. We will use Cutadapt to remove the PCR primers before any other step. If the analysis is based on a marker gene different than 16S, other quality trimming may be required. In the case of the ITS marker gene, the common practice is to trim off the conserved regions (SSU, 5.8S or LSU) that may be contained in the final amplicon. The ‘ITSxpress’ software (Rivers et al., 2018) is designed for this specific task and it is available as a QIIME2 plug-in, though it requires specific installation steps because it is not installed with the basic (core) installation process. Plugins page for ITSxpress: (https://old-library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-itsxpress/8/) For all plugins see the following 2 pages: Plugins webpage of new QIIME2 site (not all plugins transferred to new site): https://library.qiime2.org/pluginshttps://docs.qiime2.org/2024.5/plugins/available/. Plugins webpage of old QIIME2 site (These should still work for newer version of QIIME2): https://old-library.qiime2.org/plugins/. 3.4 Amplicon Sequence Variants identification The key element of this type of metagenomic analysis is the identification of the different rRNA variants in the sample. 3.4.1 OTUs The most used procedure to identify OTUs is through the clustering of reads into groups that are sufficiently similar to one another. These grouped reads are likely to come from the same rRNA gene, genome or taxa group. The identified OTUs are a feature of the sequence dataset, heavily dependent on the similarity level used for OTU identification. The most commonly used threshold was 3% dissimilarity (i.e 97% similarity) to group reads into species OTUs. Therefore, de novo OTUs identified in two different data sets cannot be compared. There is no single perfect tool for this step; but a few of the most widely used were: UCLUST VSEARCH CD-Hit SWARM The number of reads in each OTU should reflect the number of copies of the gene in the sample, thus providing a quantitative measure of diversity. 3.4.2 ASVs There are now many bioinformatic methods to resolve ASVs from Illumina data. These methods do not impose the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds that define molecular OTUs. Due to this we recommend using ASVs over OTU clustering for metagenetic analysis (unless you have a good reason to use OTU clustering). The two methods available in QIIME2 are DADA2 and deblur. ASV methods infer the biological sequences in the sample prior to the introduction of amplification and sequencing errors, and distinguish sequence variants differing by as little as one nucleotide. The methods use a de novo process in which biological sequences are discriminated from errors on the basis of, in part, the expectation that biological sequences are more likely to be repeatedly observed than error-containing sequences. Unlike de novo OTUs, ASVs are consistent labels because ASVs represent a biological reality that exists outside of the data being analysed: the DNA sequence of the assayed organism. Thus, ASVs inferred independently from different studies or different samples can be compared. The following picture shows how DADA2 (an ASV method) and OTU processes compare to each other. This shows how the canonical creation of OTUs by clustering may lead to an overestimation of the size of the OTUs due to the presence of errors, from either PCR or sequencing. Much of the work involved in the analysis of amplicon-based metagenomic data is that of separating true variants from errors introduced by sequencing. These errors include miscalling of nucleotides and the generation of chimeric sequences. For sequencing purposes, an aliquot of PhiX phage DNA is added to each sample before sequencing, both DADA2 and deblur include a step aimed to exclude any PhiX associated reads. To remove PCR chimeric artefacts, a further filter step is applied by both. QIIME 2 Authors suggest using DADA2 for read pairs and ‘deblur’ for already paired (stitched/joined) sequences. Please note that it is good practice to remove/trim out sequences containing Ns before the error correction step. It is not suggested to denoise with DADA2 samples from different sequencing lanes, because each lane may introduce different sequencing biases. It is possible to collate the denoised abundance tables and representative sequences afterwards, recording the sequencing lane for each sample in a specific metadata column. The ‘deblur’ denoise tool may be used in this case because it should be less sensitive to these possible biases, however it is good practice to keep the lane of origin in the metadata (with the second benefit that ‘deblur’ is also faster than ‘DADA2’). 3.5 Assign a taxonomic classification to each ASV The sequence of each ASV is compared with the selected database, to identify the most likely taxonomy for each ASV. Unfortunately different parts of the taxonomic identification step may lead to different results for the same ASV. Different databases may result in different taxonomic classification for the same ASV. The choice of tool used for taxonomic assignment may also impact the results in a similar way. The current version of QIIME2 allows you to select from either the Scikit-learn classifier (a classifier which applies a machine learning approach and therefore needs training before use) or BLAST+ and VSEARCH (for a global alignment approach followed by a last common ancestor search) for this step. In the practical we will use Scikit-learn (similar to the RDP tool widely used so far). It has been shown that (at least in the case of 16S analysis) taxonomic classification accuracy improves when the classifier is trained with sequences derived from the amplicon region only (Werner et al., 2012). 3.6 Phylogenetic tree creation To include phylogenetic diversity metrics in the diversity analysis, such as UniFrac distance metrics, the construction of a phylogenetic tree for the identified ASVs is required. QIIME2 supports MAFFT for the alignment and MASK to mask the alignment sections that are not phylogenetically informative. Unrooted and rooted trees may be created. For some marker genes it is not possible to build a phylogenetic tree (ITS is among these), and it is therefore important to know the properties of the marker in use. Consequently, it is not possible to use any diversity metrics that requires the phylogenetic distance as input. 3.7 Data normalisation Any further analyses to compare the identified ASVs among sample groups (either alpha- or beta-diversity or differential abundance) should account for the features of the abundance table that can cause erroneous results (Weiss et al., 2017). These features are: The microbial community in each sample may be represented by different numbers of sequences (i.e. sequencing depth for each sample). The abundance table is usually sparse. That is, most of the ASVs are present only in a few samples and therefore the abundance table contains many ‘0’ values (it is also possible that a particular species is present in a sample but below the detection limit of the methods). The total number of sequences obtained reflect the relative abundance of species sequenced rather that the absolute abundance of the species present in the sample (this is commonly referred as ‘compositional nature’ of the data). The relative abundances for the taxa are therefore not independent as in the underlying assumption of many frequently used statistical methods (Gloor et al., 2017). A normalisation step for the data is required to mitigate these effects and to allow easier data interpretation. The most used normalisation methods are: Normalisation by rarefaction. This is performed by reducing all the samples at the same sequence count, by random sub-sampling of the sequences. This method may lead to a potential reduction of the species in your dataset (alpha-diversity) and to the exclusion of any samples not reaching the selected total count per sample. DESeq method (borrowed from transcriptomic research) Scaling the abundance table by a fixed value or proportion. Applying a log-ratio transformation proposed by Aitchinson (1982) in analogy of compositional dataset. This is aimed to convert the abundance data into scales on which it is possible to apply conventional statistical procedures. Methods b-d convert the abundance table in a normalised-abundance table with different strengths and pitfalls, therefore they can affect results for beta-diversity and differential abundant analysis. These normalisation methods were compared by Weiss and colleagues (2017), but their simulations show that different methods may result in different sensitivity and different false discovery rates. In this tutorial, following the QIIME2 current tutorial and other literature, we will apply the ‘rarefaction’ method, in the context of the alpha- and beta-diversity analysis. 3.8 Alpha-diversity Alpha-diversity is used to measure the diversity within a sample. It is calculated as a value for each sample. Different metrics were developed to calculate diversity in different ways. It combines richness (a measure of the number of features in the sample) and evenness (a measure of the relative abundances of different features that make up the richness of that sample). Alpha diversity measures cannot be compared unless they have been normalised for the difference in sequencing depth between samples. The QIIME2 release we will use supports the following alpha-diversity measures, amongst others: Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, Simpson evenness, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (the only one considering the phylogenetic relationships among the ASVs). The alpha-diversity metric used for the analysis must be chosen carefully, considering its mathematical definition in relation to the behaviour of the tools used for the previous steps. An important point to consider is whether the chosen metric uses ASVs with only 1 sequence (‘singletons’) to perform some estimation on the dataset or not. The Chao1 metric, as one example for this, uses the number of singletons in the dataset to infer the total number of singletons in the population. However, the DADA2 denoising step excludes ‘singletons’ from the final output, making Chao1 measures not applicable to its resulting abundance tables. A second consideration regards if the phylogenetic tree is available enabling the use of the Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity metric, for markers such as ITS this metric would not be possible. 3.9 Beta-diversity Beta-diversity is a term for the comparison of samples to each other. It is also referred to as beta-diversity ordination, because it uses one (or more) technique/s to arrange samples along axes on the basis of their composition to highlight the differences. The starting point of the analysis is a dissimilarity matrix, which is used to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension for display purpose. The axes obtained from the PCA analysis are then compared with the categories in the metadata file to identify patterns. A few of the commonly used beta diversity metrics supported by QIIME2 are: Jaccard: A non-phylogeny based method that takes into account the presence/absence of ASVs to measure the distance between two samples. Bray-Curtis: A non-phylogeny based method that takes into account the number of ASVs and their abundance to determine the distance between two samples. Un-weighted UniFrac: Uses the presence and absence of ASVs and their phylogenies. Weighted UniFrac: Uses the abundance information of ASVs and their phylogenies. As discussed for the alpha-diversity, before proceeding with the beta-diversity analysis the raw abundance table for the identified ASVs needs to be normalised. QIIME2 suggests using the rarefaction methods at the same rarefaction threshold used for the alpha diversity. The choice of the beta-diversity distance metric to use will strongly affect the results. Therefore it is common practice to compare the results obtained with different metrics. Again, not all the metrics may be applicable to all the marker genes. E.g. the UniFrac distances could not be easily used in the case of ITS, because ITS sequences are quite difficult to align onto phylogenetic trees. 3.10 Differential Abundance Analysis The identification of taxa that are differentially abundant across experimental conditions may be an important result for many types of metagenetics analyses. This step is extremely dependent on the normalization methods used to compare the samples: using different normalisation methods may lead to different results (consequently this is another active area of research). QIIME2 supports two methods to investigate differentially abundant taxa across experimental conditions: ANCOM-BC (Lin &amp; Peddada, 2020) and GNEISS (Morton et al, 2017). Both methods are based on the conversion of the abundance values using the clr-transformation method prior to any comparison. Because the conversion is based on a logarithmic transformation, all the values in the abundance table will be increased by ‘1’ to avoid ‘0’ counts (adding pseudo-counts). These methods may therefore artificially increase the alpha-diversity for the samples as well as decrease the beta-diversity distances in the dataset. In this analysis we will use the ANCOM-BC method following the current QIIME2 tutorial. This method computes the log-ratio for every possible pair of the identified taxa (using the mean group values for the clr-transformed abundance) and reports how many times the hypothesis “H 0 = X is not differentially abundant” is rejected for each taxa ‘X’. That is the ‘W’ statistic, the higher this value is the more significant the ASV/taxa X is differentially abundant between the tested groups. This test assumes that a large number of ASVs did not change in abundances between groups. If, in the results, more than 25% of the ASVs changes in the examined contrasts, the underlying hypothesis for the ANCOM-BC test may be not fulfilled, and there is the chance that the results may be misleading. Important to note is that ANCOM-BC has its own sample-wise normalisation. Therefore the unnormalised (i.e. pre rarefaction) abundance table shoudl be provided to ANCOM-BC. Examples of questions to answer: Are there differences in taxa at various levels of taxonomy? What are the most abundant ASVs (or species)? What are the rare ASVs present (either real or still retained sequencing error)? Where are the rare ASVs present (if not sequencing error)? ASVs correlation: is there a correlation between ASVs and other attributes of samples, like pH or other environmental conditions?

Our sequencing data is of the 16S rRNA V4 region (length: ~250bp). Therefore, our 250bp x 2 paired end reads should overlap. If R1 and R2 overlap, we can use this to reconstruct the V4 region by aligning and merging the forward and reverse reads of each pair. However, before we carry this out we will need to remove any sequence data that is not biologically relevant. This includes the primer sequences that were used in the Illumina sequencing. 8.1 Cutadapt: run We will use the “cutadapt” (Martin, 2011) tool to remove the PCR primer sequences from R1 and R2.

This visualisation contains the same sections as paired-end-demux.qzv but contains information on the PCR trimmed data. If you are working with the ITS region, to trim off the conserved regions from the sequences you can use the ‘q2-itxpress’ plug in. To install and use this plug-in, please see its specific manual: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/itsxpress/tree/main Depending on your experimental design, you may have to perform the trimming of the PCR primer, sequencing adapters and/or using the conserved region using the ‘itsxpress’ trimming only. 8.3 Cutadapt: MCQs Which sample has the lowest number of forward reads? 1TE 2K2E 3K1E Which sample has the highest number of forward reads? 1TE 2K2E 3K1E Approximately, at which base position do you see a drastic drop of quality in the forward reads (thick bars drop below Q20)? &lt;200 200-220 &gt;220 Approximately, at which base position do you see a drastic drop of quality in the reverse reads (thick bars drop below Q20)? &lt;200 200-220 &gt;220 What is the median length of the forward reads? 226 230 250 8.4 Cutadapt: summary Superb!

QIIME2 docs on qiime dada2 denoise-paired 9.1.1 Truncation length We chose 220 for --p-trunc-len-f &amp; --p-trunc-len-r as the read quality was very good up to the 220 bp position for both the forward and reverse reads. Additionally, our amplicon length is ~291bp. The combined length of our forward and reverse reads is 440bp, therefore we would have an overlap greater than 100bp which is very good (440 - 291 = 149bp). As a reminder we are using the primer 515FB-806RB for the V4 16S rRNA gene. The name 515FB-806RB represents the location within an E.coli 16S gene that the primers will hit (515 for the forward, 806 for the reverse). Therefore the amplicon length for E.coli will be 806 - 515 = 291bp. As with all genes this size will vary in length across all the bacterial taxa but only by a few base pairs. 9.1.2 Copy DADA2 output The command will take a long time, so stop the command (ctrl+c), if you started it, and copy the final output files, which have been previously made, to your current directory: #Copy the files from the specified directory to your working directory cp /pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/16s_workshop/chapter_9/* ~/Metagenetics Through the above command you will now have the following three files: rep-seqs-dada2.qza: Artifact containing the identified sequence variants. table-dada2.qza: Artifact containing the ASV abundance table. dada2-stats.qza: Artifact which summarises the statistics after the denoising steps. 9.1.3 DADA2 considerations This may be one of the longest steps of the whole pipeline. The running time is proportional to the complexity of the sequences (how many ASVs are in the dataset) and to the quality of the sequences (how many errors are present). If this step is taking too long in one of your future projects, you may try to use ‘deblur’ to de-noise your data (after joining the reads with vsearch), which is generally faster. In the case of a marker gene with a high variability in amplicon sequence lengths, as in the case of ITS amplicon sequencing, a possible alternative denoising strategy is to disable the filtering by truncation length using the options: --p-trunc-len-f 0 and --p-trunc-len-r 0. To exclude the low quality tails the --p-trunc-q 20 option is now required, this option will trim all the sequences after the first base with quality below ‘20’ (this may be very stringent, so you may want to try with lower values as well). A further possibility may be to use only either the forward or reverse read file, for this the qiime dada2 denoise-single should be used instead of the above dada2 command. 9.2 table-dada2.qzv To visualise information on the ASV table we will run: qiime feature-table summarize \\ --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --o-visualization table-dada2.qzv \\ --m-sample-metadata-file metadata.file.txt Parameters --i-table: Input artifact file containing the abundance table of the ASVs. --o-visualization: Output visualisation artifact. --m-sample-metadata-file: Metadata file for our samples.

You will now see a denoising stats table with the following columns: sample-id input: Number of sequence pairs the sample started with prior to the denoising steps. filtered: Number of sequence pairs retained after user specified filtering (e.g. --p-trunc-len-f 220 will truncate forward reads but also remove sequence pairs where the forward length is shorter than 220). percentage of input passed filter: Percentage of input reads that passed the filtering step. denoised: Number of filtered sequence pairs that were successfully denoised. merged: Number of filtered and denoised paired sequences that were successfully merged (forward and reverse read merged into one sequence). percentage of input merged: Percentage of input reads that passed the filtering, denoising, and merging steps. non-chimeric: Number of filtered, denoised, and merged sequences retained after chimera removal. This is the final number of sequences per sample. percentage of input non-chimeric: Percentage of input reads retained at the end. This visualisation is very useful to see where our sequences are being filtered. It is possible to be too stringent and not have enough sequences for some samples. This will give you an idea on how you can repeat the denoising stats with changed options to retain more samples. 9.3.1 dada2-stats.qzv: MCQs Attempt the below MCQs.

Our reads have been filtered, denoised, and merged. Additionally, chimeras have been removed. With this carried out we have an ASV abundance table, representative sequences, and stats on the various steps that have been carried out. Through visualising the table and stats we can determine that there are a good amount of sequences per sample (&gt;20,000) and there is a good amount of samples per sample group.

We have trimmed and denoised our data, producing ASVs. This has been followed by assigning taxonomic classifications to the ASVs. In your future analysis if you have sequenced any samples with known composition (e.g. mock community), now is the time to see if they behave as expected. Do they contain what you expect? You may want to change some steps and/or settings of what you have done so far if the composition does not match what you expect. For example, change the de-noising tool or apply more quality filters to further improve the quality of the sequence under examination. We are close to carrying out some biodiversity analysis.

An incompletely sampled community will appear less diverse than a fully sampled community. To compare the diversity between samples we need to account for their different sampling depths. This can be carried out with rarefaction. Rarefaction is performed by reducing all the samples to the same sequence count, by random sub-sampling of the sequences. For example, if we rarefy to a depth of 2000 for all samples: Samples with depths of &lt;2000 will be removed. Samples with depths of 2000 will be unchanged. Samples with depths of &gt;2000 will have all reads removed except for a random subsample of 2000. Equally sized subsamples are directly comparable among different samples. Additionally, we can progressively subsample from a sample to draw a curve of estimated alpha diversity. The shape of this curve is informative. If the curve plateaus, then increased sampling depth will not increase the estimate of alpha diversity (the community is fully sampled). Figure: Example rarefaction curve. We can see that S1 plateaus at ~6,000 sequences and S3 plateaus at ~16,000 sequences whilst S2 has not started to plateau. 12.1 Rarefaction: run Given an abundance table (and a phylogenetic tree for calculating phylogenetic distance), we can plot rarefaction curves using different alpha-diversity metrics. Here, we will use diversity metrics (observed features, Simpson, Shannon, Faith’s PD) as well as an evenness metric (Simpson’s evenness). Note: See the appendix at the end of this bookdown for details on each metric. You will need to to exclude --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza and --p-metrics faith_pd for markers such as ITS where you cannot create a phylogenetic tree. Important: This command will take a long time.

The minimum and maximum depth are chosen based on your knowledge of the sample depths. This can be figured out from the 'table-dada2.qzv' file. --p-steps: The number of rarefaction steps to include between the min and max depth. This means there will be x points on the sequence depth axis (x-axis) in the resulting plot. The more steps there are the longer the command will take to run. In your future analysis it may take some experimentation to get a number of steps that is a good amount. Too many steps and it can be messy, too few steps and it can be uninformative --p-iterations: This is the number of rarefaction tables that will created. The final output is based on the average of these tables. Although a very large number would be very good it would also take a very long time. The number of iterations increase the time by that amount (i.e. 2 iterations takes 2 times more than 1 iteration). Ten iterations is generally a good amount. --m-metadata-file: Metadata file for our samples. --p-metrics: This parameter indicates which alpha diversity to use for rarefaction.

QIIME2 docs on qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction 12.1.1 Copy rarefaction output Instead of running the command you can copy the output to your directory. cp /pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/16s_workshop/chapter_12/rarefaction-curve.qzv . 12.2 Rarefaction: visualise Load the output visualisation artifact into QIIME2 view. You can select the alpha diversity Metric to visualise as well as the groupings (Sample Metadata Column, where each BarcodeSequence represents a sample). Generally the observed_features metric is the best Metric to view. The visualisation has two plots. Top plot: Alpha rarefaction plot. Primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples has been fully observed or sequenced. If the lines in the plot appear to \"plateau\" (i.e., becoming a horizontal line), this suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth will not effect the measured metric. E.g. a plateaued observed feature curve indicates there are no more feature to be detected. If the lines in the observed feature plot do not level out: The richness of the samples may have not been fully observed (because too few sequences were collected). Or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing errors remain in the data (which is being mistaken for novel diversity). Bottom plot: Number of samples (Y) against sequencing depth (X) This is important when grouping samples by metadata. It illustrates the number of samples with different sequencing depths for the groups in the chosen Sample Metadata Column. This is useful as when a sample's sequencing depth is lower than the sequencing depth in the rarefaction plot it will no longer be considered in the rarefaction calculation. This can be seen as jitters in the rarefaction curve corresponding to a decrease in number of samples. If the lost sample had a lower value than the average of the group the curve will jitter upwards, as the group average increases. If the lost sample had a higher value than the average of the group the curve will jitter downwards, as the group average decreases. 12.2.1 Rarefaction considerations Choosing a rarefaction threshold for the normalisation step, is ultimately identifying the best trade-off between: Retaining sequencing depth within samples. Not losing entire samples. The best choice usually depends on the experimental design. If you have many samples per group you may be able to lose a few samples without losing statistical power for the analysis. If you have few samples per group you may need to choose a lower threshold. Other considerations for rarefaction threshold: Do the samples in one group have lower depths? Although you may be able to retain all the samples in the other groups with a high rarefaction threshold you may remove too much of the low depth group. Should your samples have relatively high (e.g. soil microbiomes) or low (e.g. human gut microbiome) diversity. With higher diversity you will need a larger rarefaction threshold. 12.2.2 Rarefaction: MCQs Attempt the below MCQs. At approximately what sequencing depth do the rarefaction curves of most of the samples (&gt;90%) plateaue? 10,000 25,000 50,000 Comparing the two Locations, which has higher evenness scores (simpson_e)? Corridor Toilet Comparing the two Locations, which has a higher Faith's PD scores? Corridor Toilet When comparing the two Places, at approximately what sequencing depth are there only 6 MainBuilding samples remaining? 70,000 90,000 115,000 When comparing the two Places, at approximately what sequencing depth are there only 5 Entrance samples remaining? 70,000 90,000 115,000 12.3 Rarefaction: summary For the next step we will use a rarefaction size of 34,584. We have chosen this depth because: This will keep all the samples. The group based rarefaction curves (Location and Place) are plateauing at this depth. Many of the individual samples (BarcodeSequence) have plateaued at this depth. We do not have a lot of samples so we have prioritised keeping them rather than removing samples for a relatively small gain. How do we know that the very exact number of 34,584 will keep all the samples? Looking at the Interactive Sample Detail section of the table-dada2.qzv visualisation we can see that the lowest depth of a sample is 34,584 (3K1E). Generally people will use the depth of a sample as the rarefaction threshold. E.g. if we were going to choose a rarefaction threshold of &gt;50k we'd pick 58,605 as the exact threshold, this is the lowest sample depth &gt;50k (from sample 1K2M). This allows us to use the maximum amount of sequences per sample. "],["13-Diversity_analysis.html", "Chapter 13 Diversity analysis 13.1 Diversity: run", " Chapter 13 Diversity analysis Alpha diversity is a representation of the diversity within a sample. There are many possible metrics for estimating alpha diversity (QIIME2 allows 30 metrics to be estimated), including the “Shannon” metric, the number of observed features and Faith’s phylogenetic distance (Shannon, 1948, Faith, 1992). Beta diversity is diversity among different communities. There are many possible metrics to represent the distance among samples (QIIME2 allows 34 to be estimated). We will use the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics (Lozupone and Knight, 2005, Lozupone et al., 2007) and the Bray-Curtis metric (Bray and Curtis, 1957) (More info on these metrics in the appendix). 13.1 Diversity: run QIIME2 includes a wrapper script to co-investigate alpha- and beta-diversity at the same time. This script includes only a selected list of alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, but these are usually enough to investigate the dataset. It is possible to use different metrics using the single scripts for alpha and beta-diversity (https://amplicon-docs.qiime2.org/en/latest/references/plugins/diversity.html). qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \\ --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \\ --p-sampling-depth 34584 \\ --output-dir dada2-diversity-34584 \\ --m-metadata-file metadata.file.txt Parameters --i-table: Input artifact containing the abundance table for the identified variants. --i-phylogeny: Input artifact containing the rooted tree. --p-sampling-depth: Sampling depth to rarefy the abundance data table to. --output-dir: Output directory that will contain all the output files from the command. --m-metadata-file: Metadata file for our samples.

The QIIME2 pipeline offers two alternative choices: Categorical metadata: Kruskal-Wallis test. Numerical metadata: Ranked Spearman (correlation) test. 14.1 Alpha diversity: run As we have categorical (Location &amp; Place) and numeric (Floor) metadata columns we will carry out both types of tests.

At this point I will remind you to have only one chrome window open which is to be left open. Also make sure to close tabs you don't need any more (always leaving one open). At the top of both the outputs is a drop down menu labelled \"Column\" that can be used to display the plot and stats of your chosen metadata grouping. As there was only one numeric column (Floors) there will only be one option in the Ranked Spearman output. Kruskal-Wallis The Kruskal-Wallis (shannon-group-significance.kw.qzv) visualisation artifact contains: Alpha Diversity Boxplots: Displays the alpha diversity values plotted as box plots comparing the chosen metadata column. Kruskal-Wallis (all groups): Displays the stats for the all groups comparison. These stats will be different to the pairwise comparisons if there are more than 2 groups. Kruskal-Wallis (pairwise): Displays the stats for the all the pairwise group comparison. To determine if there is a statistical difference between the groups it is best to look at the q-value/s in the pairwise table. The q-value is in essence the multiple comparison corrected p-value. As there is only one pairwise comparison in each of the 2 categorical metadata groupings the q-value is the same as the p-value (no multiple testing carried out). Example with more groups in the metadata columns Ranked Spearman The Ranked Spearman (shannon-group-significance.rs.qzv) visualisation artifact contains: Plot: This plots the alpha diversity values as a scatterplot. The x-axis contains the numeric values form the metadata. The y-axis contains the alpha diversity values. Stats table: The Spearman ranked correlation statistics table. You can look at the p-value to determine if there is a statistical significant correlation between the numeric category and the alpha diversity metric. 14.2.1 Alpha diversity: MCQs Is there a statistical significance (q-value &lt;0.05) when comparing the Locations (Corridor vs Toilet) when using Shannon diversity?

We'll use 'PERMANOVA' analysis to determine if the separation of samples by metadata groups has statistical significance or if it may have just originated by chance. 15.1 Beta diveristy: PCoA Before running some statistical analysis let's look at one of the PCoA plots created in the the qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic command. Open the file weighted_uinifrac_emperor.qzv in QIIME2 view. Set the \"Select a Color Category\" drop down to \"Location\". Clicking and dragging on the plot, manipulate your view of the 3-D plot until you separate the \"Corridor\" and \"Toilet\" samples. We are able to visually separate these two groups in the plot, especially on Axis 2. However, will some statistics back this up? 15.2 Beta diversity: run For our first 'PERMANOVA' analysis we will use the weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza file.

The other parameter choice is --p-no-pairwise meaning only the test across all groups will be carried out. This can be used if there are a lot of groups in the metadata column that may make cause the command to take too long to run. --p-permutations: The number of permutations to run when computing p-values. The default is 999. --o-visualization: The output artifact containing the visualisation. QIIME2 docs on qiime diversity beta-group-significance 15.3 Beta diversity: visualise Load the resulting visualisation (weighted-unifrac-significance.location.qzv) file in QIIME2 view. You will see the following sections: Overview: An overview of the statistical analysis for the metadata column. Group significance plot: These boxplots represent all the pairwise distances between the samples in the specified groups. Example: Distances to Corridor plot Corridor boxplot: This boxplot represents all the pairwise distances within the Corridor samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-C2, C1-C3, and C2-C3. Toilet boxplot: This boxplot represents the pairwise distances between all the corridor samples and toilet samples. If you had 3 corridor samples (C1-3) and 2 toilet samples (T1-2) the boxplot would consist of the distances between C1-T1, C1-T2, C2-T1, C2-T2, C3-T1, and C3-T2. With these plots you can see if the distances within a group are smaller than the distances between that group and other groups. Pairwise results: This section shows the statistical results comparing the different groups in pairwise fashion. The best values to look at are: Sample size: Good to determine if there are enough samples for statistical strength. q-value: Always go for q-values over p-values.

Note: You will need to run the qiime diversity beta-group-significance with different options and view the new files to answer some of the questions. Is there a significant difference (q-value &lt;0.05) between Corridor and Toilet (Location) for the weighted unifrac distances when using PERMANOVA? Yes No Which sample group, Corridor or Toilet, has larger weighted unifrac distances within the group? I.e. which boxplot has the IQR with the largest values: \"Distances to Corridor\" - \"Corridor\" box plot, or \"Distances to Toilet\", \"Toilet\" box plot? Corridor Toilet In the weighted unifrac distances \"Distances to Corridor\" box plots, which box plot has lower values? Corridor Toilet Is there a significant difference (q-value &lt;0.05) between Corridor and Toilet (Location) for the Bray Curtis distances when using PERMANOVA? Yes No Is there a significant difference (q-value &lt;0.05) between Entrance and MainBuilding (Place) for the Unweighted Unifrac distances when using ANOSIM? Yes No 15.3.2 Beta diversity: summary Viewing the beta diversity ordination plots and the statistical output we can see there is a difference between the Corridor and Toilet samples. However, there does not appear to be a difference between the Entrance and MainBuilding samples from our quick look. Additionally, the distances within the Corridor samples are smaller than the distances within the Toilet samples. This indicates that the Corridor samples have less variation than the Toilet samples. If you want to carry out multi-way ADONIS tests you can use the qiime diversity adonis plugin.

It is an improvement of the original ANCOM method but with added bias correction. This bias correction aims to account for the bias caused by the difference in sampling/depth across the samples. Differential abundance analysis aims to detect features (ASVs, taxa, etc.) that have different abundances between groups. An example of its use is to detect organisms in high abundance in diseased states versus healthy states. This helps determine what are the disease causing organisms. However, it may also detect organisms that are able to survive in the environment rather than those that cause the difference in environment. If you are still in 'dada2-diversity-34584' directory, please remember to move out: cd .. 16.1 Taxa collapse First, we need to collapse the ASVs into taxa. This is done as seeing which ASVs are differentially abundant with no taxonomic information is not very useful. Let us choose Greengenes2 level 5 which equates to family. qiime taxa collapse \\ --i-table table-dada2.qza \\ --i-taxonomy taxonomy.sklearn.qza \\ --p-level 5 \\ --o-collapsed-table table-l5.qza Parameters --i-table: Input artifact containing the abundance table (non-rarefied) for the identified variants. --i-taxonomy: Input artifact containing the taxonomic classifications of the ASVs. --p-level: The taxonomic level at which the features should be collapsed.

In this case we are specifying the metadata column, Location, within the metadata file to use for the statistical analysis.

For example The values for LocationToilet would equal LFC(Toilet - Corridor). A positive value means the abundances are higher in the comparison group (Toilet) and lower in the ref (Corridor). A negative value means the abundances are lower in the comparison group (Toilet) and higher in the ref (Corridor). The intercept value is the grand mean and is likely not of interest. p_val: The P-value. q_val: The Q-value.

Are there any missing taxa you know should be there? These taxa may be present but are not being detected for a few reasons, first of all, are these represented in the taxonomical database you are using?

If this still does not work, you can change the method to pick up the representative sequence and/or the clustering at the earlier stages of the analysis. The failure could be right at the beginning of the project design. It is worth checking if the PCR primers you are using can amplify these species. Are the primers known to impose bias on the community you are amplifying? Are the primers unable to amplify some taxon whose 16S rRNA sequences are too distant from the rest of the community? The literature may be able to help you on this topic. If you are happy with the composition, you can then explore the ecological differences among your samples. For this there are other analyses you may want to approach including: Inferring ecological interaction networks (SPIEC-EASI). More statistical analyses with STAMP. Or you can import your results in R to analyse them with Phyloseq. We have workshop on this, check our training webpage to see if it is open for registration.

C Mamba installs C.1 Mamba installation and environment Mamba is a reimplementation of conda. It is a great tool for installing bioinformatic packages including R packages. Mamba github: https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba The best way to use Mamba is to install Miniforge. It has both Conda and Mamba commands. Miniforge installation: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge Mamba guide: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html To create the mamba environment qiime2-amplicon-2025.10 run the below commands in your bash. You will need to have installed mamba first. #QIIME2 conda env create \\ --name qiime2-amplicon-2025.10 \\ --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/distributions/refs/heads/dev/2025.10/amplicon/released/qiime2-amplicon-ubuntu-latest-conda.yml Note: You may want to install the most recent version of QIIME2. Please see the following page for installation instructions: https://library.qiime2.org/quickstart/amplicon. D Diversity metrics D.1 Alpha diversity metrics Alpha diversity measures assess the diversity of each sample separately. Generally a higher value of these indexes/measures indicates higher diversity/evenness. D.1.1 Observed features The observed number of features is defined as the number of distinct features, such as ASVs, within a sample. The number of observed features can also be known as the feature richness of a sample. A sample with more present features than another would be said to be richer. D.1.2 Evenness How evenly spread the abundances are across all present features. A sample with 4 ASVs, each with 25% relative abundance would be perfectly even. A sample with 4 ASVs, where one ASV has 97% abundance and the other 3 have 1%, would be highly uneven. D.1.3 Faith's PD (phylogenetic diversity) Faith's PD represents the minimum total branch length that covers all taxa within the sample on a phylogenetic tree (Faith, 1992). A smaller PD value indicates a reduced expected taxonomic diversity whilst a large PD value indicates a higher expected diversity. A sample with 10 ASVs could have a lower Faith's PD than a sample with only 2 ASVs. This could occur if the 10 ASV sample only has ASVs from one genus whilst the 2 ASV samples consists of ASVs from 2 different Families. D.1.4 Simpson A measure of diversity based on number of features present and the relative abundance of each feature. If richness and evenness increase the diversity score increases. Equation: \\[ D = 1 - {( \\frac {\\sum n{(n-1)}} {N{(N-1)}} )} \\] D = Simpson diversity index n = Abundance of feature N = Total feature abundance of sample The values range from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (infinite diversity). D.1.5 Simpson evenness measure (simpson_e) This is a measure of evenness based on the Simpson index. It ranges from 0 (lowest eveness) to 1 (complete evenness). It compares the calculated Simpson Index of a sample to its theoretical maximum if the sample was perfectly even but had the same amount of features. Equation: \\[ E_D = \\frac{D} {D_m} \\] ED = Simpson evenness measure D = Simpson diversity index Dm = Max possible Simpson diveristy index given the number of features D.1.6 Shannon A measure of diversity where a higher number means higher diversity. Shannon's index accounts for both abundance and evenness of the feaures present. Equation: \\[ H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i lnp_i \\] H = Shannon diversity index p = n/N n = Abundance of feature N = Total feature abundance of sample D.2 Beta diversity metrics Beta diversity compares 2 samples at a time. This is measured in terms of dissimilarity: A lower score indicate the 2 samples are more similar. A higher score indicates the 2 samples are more dissimilar. D.2.1 Weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances The UniFrac metric is a phylogenetic distance measure between two samples. It is defined as “the sum of the unshared branch lengths between two samples divided by the total branch length (shared + unshared) of two samples” (Lozupone and Knight, 2005). This results in calculating the fraction of the branch lengths unique to each sample (ie. the higher this value is, the more dissimilar two samples are). The entire phylogenetic tree created for all the sequences of all the analysed samples is used for this calculation. Unweighted UniFrac: Only considers feature presence/absence. Weighted UniFrac: Takes into account feature presence/absence &amp; abundance. I.e. the value is weighted by the abundances. D.2.2 Bray-Curtis The Bray-Curtis metric is a dissimilarity measure that can quantify the level of difference between two samples. Two identical samples would have a Bray-Curtis measure of 0 (i.e. they have 0 dissimilarity). There are 2 versions but the one used by QIIME2 looks at the number of features shared by the 2 samples. Equation: \\[ CBC = 1 – (\\frac{2c} {a + b}) \\] c = # features present in both samples a = # features present in sample a b = # features present in sample b D.3 Diversity Resources For more diveristy measure please see: https://forum.qiime2.org/t/alpha-and-beta-diversity-explanations-and-commands/2282 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
